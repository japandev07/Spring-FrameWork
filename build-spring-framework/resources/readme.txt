http://www.springframework.org

1. INTRODUCTION

This is the fourth milestone of Spring 3.0 which is scheduled for final release in Q3 2009.
It is nearly feature complete, with only very specific areas still being worked on for RC1.

2. RELEASE NOTES

This release comes with complete reference documentation already. Consult the provided
javadoc for technical details of specific packages and classes.

3. DISTRIBUTION JAR FILES

The Spring Framework module jar files can be found in the 'dist' directory. Note that
this release does not contain a 'spring.jar' file anymore, in contrast to previous Spring
generations. Furthermore, the jar file names follow bundle repository conventions now.

4. GETTING STARTED

A Getting Started guide is to be provided in time for Spring 3.0 GA. For the time being,
please consult the blog examples at http://blog.springsource.com as well as the sections
of interest in the reference documentation.
