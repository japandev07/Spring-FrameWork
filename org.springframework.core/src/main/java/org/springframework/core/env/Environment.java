/**
 * Interface representing the environment in which the current application is running.
 * Models two key aspects of the application environment:
 * <ol>
 *   <li>profiles</li>
 *   <li>properties</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * A <em>profile</em> is a named, logical group of bean definitions to be registered with the
 * container only if the given profile is <em>active</em>. Beans may be assigned to a profile
 * whether defined in XML or annotations; see the spring-beans 3.1 schema or the {@link
 * org.springframework.context.annotation.Profile @Profile} annotation for syntax details.
 * The role of the Environment object with relation to profiles is in determining which profiles
 * (if any) are currently {@linkplain #getActiveProfiles active}, and which profiles (if any)
 * should be {@linkplain #getDefaultProfiles active by default}.
 *
 * <p><em>Properties</em> play an important role in almost all applications, and may originate
 * from a variety of sources: properties files, JVM system properties, system environment
 * variables, JNDI, servlet context parameters, ad-hoc Properties objects, Maps, and so on.
 * The role of the environment object with relation to properties is to provide the user with a
 * convenient service interface for configuring property sources and resolving properties from them.
 *
 * <p>Beans managed within an ApplicationContext may register to be {@link
 * org.springframework.context.EnvironmentAware EnvironmentAware}, where they can query profile state
 * or resolve properties directly.
 *
 * <p>More commonly, beans will not interact with the Environment directly, but will have ${...}
 * property values replaced by a property placeholder configurer such as {@link
 * org.springframework.context.support.PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer
 * PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer}, which itself is EnvironmentAware, and as of Spring 3.1 is
 * registered by default when using {@code <context:property-placeholder/>}.
 *
 * <p>Configuration of the environment object must be done through the {@link ConfigurableEnvironment}
 * interface, returned from all AbstractApplicationContext subclass getEnvironment() methods. See
 * {@link DefaultEnvironment} for several examples of using the ConfigurableEnvironment interface
 * to manipulate property sources prior to application context refresh().
