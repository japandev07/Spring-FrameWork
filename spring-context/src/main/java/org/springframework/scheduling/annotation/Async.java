/**
 * Annotation that marks a method as a candidate for <i>asynchronous</i> execution.
 * Can also be used at the type level, in which case all of the type's methods are
 * considered as asynchronous.
 *
 * <p>In terms of target method signatures, any parameter types are supported.
 * However, the return type is constrained to either {@code void} or
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.Future}. In the latter case, the {@code Future} handle
 * returned from the proxy will be an actual asynchronous {@code Future} that can be used
 * to track the result of the asynchronous method execution. However, since the
 * target method needs to implement the same signature, it will have to return
 * a temporary {@code Future} handle that just passes the return value through: e.g.
 * Spring's {@link AsyncResult} or EJB 3.1's {@link javax.ejb.AsyncResult}.
