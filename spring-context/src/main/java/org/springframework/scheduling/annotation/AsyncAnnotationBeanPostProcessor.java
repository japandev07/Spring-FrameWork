/**
 * Bean post-processor that automatically applies asynchronous invocation
 * behavior to any bean that carries the {@link Async} annotation at class or
 * method-level by adding a corresponding {@link AsyncAnnotationAdvisor} to the
 * exposed proxy (either an existing AOP proxy or a newly generated proxy that
 * implements all of the target's interfaces).
 *
 * <p>The {@link TaskExecutor} responsible for the asynchronous execution may
 * be provided as well as the annotation type that indicates a method should be
 * invoked asynchronously. If no annotation type is specified, this post-
 * processor will detect both Spring's {@link Async @Async} annotation as well
 * as the EJB 3.1 {@code javax.ejb.Asynchronous} annotation.
 *
 * <p>For methods having a {@code void} return type, any exception thrown
 * during the asynchronous method invocation cannot be accessed by the
 * caller. An {@link AsyncUncaughtExceptionHandler} can be specified to handle
 * these cases.
 *
 * <p>Note: The underlying async advisor applies before existing advisors by default,
 * in order to switch to async execution as early as possible in the invocation chain.
