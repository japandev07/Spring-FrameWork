/**
 * Spring's repackaging of

 * <p>This repackaging technique avoids any potential conflicts with
 * dependencies on CGLIB at the application level or from third-party
 * libraries and frameworks.
 *
 * <p>As this repackaging happens at the class file level, sources
 * and javadocs are not available here. See the original
 * <a href="http://cglib.sourceforge.net/apidocs">CGLIB 3.1 javadocs</a>
 * for details when working with these classes.
