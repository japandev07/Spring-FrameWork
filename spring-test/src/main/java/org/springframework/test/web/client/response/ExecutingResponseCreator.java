/**
 * A {@code ResponseCreator} which delegates to a {@link ClientHttpRequestFactory}
 * to perform the request and return the associated response.
 * This is notably useful when testing code that calls multiple remote services, some
 * of which need to be actually called rather than further mocked.
 * <p>Note that the input request is asserted to be a {@code MockClientHttpRequest} and
 * the URI, method, headers and body are copied.
 * <p>The factory can typically be obtained from a {@code RestTemplate} but in case this
 * is used with e.g. {@code MockRestServiceServer}, make sure to capture the factory early
 * before binding the mock server to the RestTemplate (as it replaces the factory):
 * <pre><code>
 * ResponseCreator withActualResponse = new ExecutingResponseCreator(restTemplate);
 * MockRestServiceServer server = MockRestServiceServer.bindTo(restTemplate).build();
 * //...
 * server.expect(requestTo("/foo")).andRespond(withSuccess());
 * server.expect(requestTo("/bar")).andRespond(withActualResponse);
 * </code></pre>
