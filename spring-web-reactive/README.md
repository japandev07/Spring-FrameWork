Spring Reactive is a sandbox for experimenting on the reactive support intended to be part
of Spring Framework 5. For more information about this topic, you can have a look to
[Intro to Reactive programming][] and [Reactive Web Applications][] talks.

## Downloading Artifacts
Spring Reactive JAR dependency is available from Spring snapshot repository:
 - Repository URL: `https://repo.spring.io/snapshot/`
 - GroupId: `org.springframework.reactive`
 - ArtifactId: `spring-reactive`

## Documentation
See the current [Javadoc][].
 
## Sample application
[Spring Reactive Playground] is a sample application based on Spring Reactive and on MongoDB,
Couchbase and PostgreSQL Reactive database drivers.

## Building from Source
Spring Reactive uses a [Gradle][]-based build system. In the instructions
below, `./gradlew` is invoked from the root of the source tree and serves as
a cross-platform, self-contained bootstrap mechanism for the build.

You can check the current build status on this [Bamboo Spring Reactive build][].

### Prerequisites

[Git][] and [JDK 8 update 20 or later][JDK8 build]

Be sure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the `jdk1.8.0` folder
extracted from the JDK download.

### Install all spring-\* jars into your local Maven cache
`./gradlew install`

### Compile and test; build all jars, distribution zips, and docs
`./gradlew build`
