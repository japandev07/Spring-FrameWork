This section provides basic information on the Spring Web Reactive support in Spring Framework 5.


[[web-reactive-intro]]
== Introduction


[[web-reactive-programming]]
=== Reactive Programming

In plain terms reactive programming is about non-blocking applications that are asynchronous
and event-driven and require a small number of threads to scale. A key aspect of that
definition is the concept of backpressure which is a mechanism to ensure producers
don't overwhelm consumers. For example in a pipeline of reactive components that extends
from the database to the HTTP socket when the HTTP client is slow the data
repository slows down or stops until capacity frees up.

From a programming model perspective reactive programming involves a major shift from imperative style logic
to a declarative composition of async logic. It is comparable to using `CompletableFuture` in Java 8
and composing follow-up actions via lambda expressions.

by Dave Syer.


[[web-reactive-api]]
=== Spring Web Reactive Types

Spring Framework 5 embraces
https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm#reactive-streams[Reactive Streams]
as the contract for communicating backpressure across async components and
libraries. Reactive Streams is a specification created through industry collaboration that
has also been adopted in Java 9 as `java.util.concurrent.Flow`.

The Spring Framework uses https://projectreactor.io/[Reactor] internally for its own
reactive support. Reactor is a Reactive Streams implementation that further extends the
basic Reactive Streams `Publisher` contract with the `Flux` and `Mono` composable API
types to provide declarative operations on data sequences of `0..N` and `0..1`.

The Spring Framework exposes `Flux` and `Mono` in many of its own reactive APIs.
At the application level however, as always, Spring provides choice and fully supports
the use of RxJava. For more on reactive types check the post
https://spring.io/blog/2016/04/19/understanding-reactive-types["Understanding Reactive Types"]
by Sebastien Deleuze.


[[web-reactive-feature-overview]]
== Spring Web Reactive Overview

Spring Framework 5 adds a new `spring-web-reactive` module that provides both reactive
client and server.

[[web-reactive-server]]
=== Reactive Web Server

The reactive web server is available in 2 flavors:

* With the same `@Controller` annotation-based programming model than Spring MVC
* With a new functional programming model using Java 8 lambdas

When using Spring Web Reactive, regardless of the programming model you choose, your
application is executed on a reactive non-blocking engine. The diagram below shows how
Spring MVC and Spring Web Reactive compare side by side:

image::images/web-reactive-overview.png[width=720]

Spring Web Reactive makes use of Servlet 3.1 non-blocking I/O and runs on
Servlet 3.1 containers. It also runs on non-Servlet runtimes such as Netty and Undertow.
Each runtime is adapted to a set of shared, reactive `ServerHttpRequest` and
`ServerHttpResponse` abstractions that expose the request and response body
as `Flux<DataBuffer>` with full backpressure support on the read and the
write side.

JSON or XML REST webservices are supported, as well as view rendering, server-sent events
and Websocket.

[[web-reactive-server-annotation]]
==== Annotation-based programming model

The `@Controller` programming model supported by Spring Web Reactive re-defines many of
the Spring MVC contracts such as `HandlerMapping` and `HandlerAdapter` to be asynchronous
and non-blocking and to operate on the reactive HTTP request and response. For this reason
Spring MVC and Spring Web Reactive cannot share any code. However they do share
many of the same algorithms.

The end result is a programming model identical to today's Spring MVC but
with support for reactive types and executed in a reactive manner.

Here is an example of a reactive controller declared with annotations:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@RestController
public class PersonController {

	private final PersonRepository repository;

	public PersonController(PersonRepository repository) {
		this.repository = repository;
	}

	@PostMapping("/person")
	Mono<Void> create(@RequestBody Publisher<Person> personStream) {
		return this.repository.save(personStream).then();
	}

	@GetMapping("/person")
	Flux<Person> list() {
		return this.repository.findAll();
	}

	@GetMapping("/person/{id}")
	Mono<Person> findById(@PathVariable String id) {
		return this.repository.findOne(id);
	}
}
----

[[web-reactive-server-functional]]
==== Functional programming model

The functional programming model uses Java 8 lambdas instead of annotations to allow you
to create a web application. It is built on top of simple but powerful building blocks like
`RouterFunction` and `HandlerFunction`. For more details, see this
https://spring.io/blog/2016/09/22/new-in-spring-5-functional-web-framework[blog post].

Here is an example of a Spring web functional controller:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
PersonRepository repository = ...

RouterFunctions
	.route(GET("/person/{id}").and(accept(APPLICATION_JSON)), request -> {
		int personId = Integer.valueOf(request.pathVariable("id"));
		Mono<ServerResponse> notFound = ServerResponse.notFound().build();
		return repository.findOne(personId)
				.then(person -> ServerResponse.ok().body(Mono.just(person), Person.class))
				.otherwiseIfEmpty(notFound);
	})

	.andRoute(GET("/person").and(accept(APPLICATION_JSON)), request ->
			ServerResponse.ok().body(repository.findAll(), Person.class))

	.andRoute(POST("/person").and(contentType(APPLICATION_JSON)), request ->
			ServerResponse.ok().build(repository.save(request.bodyToMono(Person.class))));
----

[[web-reactive-client]]
=== Reactive Web Client

Spring Framework 5 adds a new reactive `WebClient` in addition to the existing `RestTemplate`
and `AsyncRestTemplate`. In addition to a revised API, a big difference between
`AsyncRestTemplate` and the reactive `WebClient` is that the later allows to consume
streaming APIs like https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview[Twitter one] for example.

A `WebClient` instance use a `ClientHttpConnector` implementation to drive the underlying
supported HTTP client (e.g. Reactor Netty). This client is adapted to a set of shared,
reactive `ClientHttpRequest` and `ClientHttpResponse` abstractions that expose the request
and response body as `Flux<DataBuffer>` with full backpressure support on the read and
the write side. The `HttpMessageReader` and `HttpMessageWriter` abstractions are also used on
the client side for the serialization of a `Flux` of bytes to and from typed objects.

An example of using the `WebClient`:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
// create an immutable instance of WebClient
WebClient webClient = WebClient.create(new ReactorClientHttpConnector());

ClientRequest<Void> request = ClientRequest.GET("http://example.com/accounts/{id}", 1L)
				.accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON).build();

Mono<Account> account = this.webClient
				.exchange(request)
				.then(response -> response.bodyToMono(Account.class));
----

A `WebSocketClient` is also available.

[[web-reactive-http-body]]
=== Reading and writing HTTP body

The `spring-core` module provides reactive `Encoder` and `Decoder` contracts
that enable the serialization of a `Flux` of bytes to and from typed objects.
The `spring-web` module adds JSON (Jackson) and XML (JAXB) implementations for use in
web applications as well as others for SSE streaming and zero-copy file transfer.

Whether you use the annotation-based or functional programming model, the request body
provided can be for example one of the following ways:

* `Account account` -- the account is deserialized without
blocking before the controller is invoked.
* `Mono<Account> account` -- the controller can use the `Mono`
to declare logic to be executed after the account is deserialized.
* `Single<Account> account` -- same as with `Mono` but using RxJava
* `Flux<Account> accounts` -- input streaming scenario.
* `Observable<Account> accounts` -- input streaming with RxJava.

Similarly, the response body can be in any one of the following ways:

* `Mono<Account>` -- serialize without blocking the given Account when the `Mono` completes.
* `Single<Account>` -- same but using RxJava.
* `Flux<Account>` -- streaming scenario, possibly SSE depending on the requested content type.
* `Observable<Account>` -- same but using RxJava `Observable` type.
* `Flowable<Account>` -- same but using RxJava 2 `Flowable` type.
* `Flux<ServerSentEvent>` -- SSE streaming.
* `Mono<Void>` -- request handling completes when the `Mono` completes.
* `Account` -- serialize without blocking the given Account;
implies a synchronous, non-blocking controller method.
* `void` -- specific to the annotation-based programming model, request handling completes
when the method returns; implies a synchronous, non-blocking controller method.

== Getting Started


[[web-reactive-getting-started-boot]]
=== Spring Boot Starter

The
https://github.com/bclozel/spring-boot-web-reactive#spring-boot-web-reactive-starter[Spring Boot Web Reactive starter]
available via http://start.spring.io is the fastest way to get started if you want to use
the annotation-based programming model. It does all that's necessary so you can start
writing `@Controller` classes. By default it runs on Tomcat but the dependencies can
be changed as usual with Spring Boot to switch to a different runtime.

There is no Spring Boot Starter available yet for the functional programming model, so for
this one use the manual bootstraping method described bellow.

[[web-reactive-getting-started-manual]]
=== Manual Bootstrapping

This section outlines the steps to get up and running without Spring Boot.

For dependencies start with `spring-web-reactive` and `spring-context`.
Then add `jackson-databind` and `io.netty:netty-buffer`
(temporarily see https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-14528[SPR-14528]) for JSON support.
Lastly add the dependencies for one of the supported runtimes:

* Tomcat -- `org.apache.tomcat.embed:tomcat-embed-core`
* Jetty -- `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server` and `org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-servlet`
* Reactor Netty -- `io.projectreactor.ipc:reactor-netty`
* RxNetty -- `io.reactivex:rxnetty-common` and `io.reactivex:rxnetty-http`
* Undertow -- `io.undertow:undertow-core`

For the **annotation-based programming model**, bootstrap code start with:
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(DelegatingWebReactiveConfiguration.class);  // (1)
HttpHandler handler = DispatcherHandler.toHttpHandler(context);  // (2)
----

The above loads default Spring Web Reactive config (1), then creates a
`DispatcherHandler`, the main class driving request processing (2), and adapts
it to `HttpHandler`, the lowest level Spring abstraction for reactive HTTP request handling.

For the **functional programming model**, bootstrap code start with:
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(); // (1)
context.registerBean(FooBean.class, () -> new FooBeanImpl()); // (2)
context.registerBean(BarBean.class); // (3)
HttpHandler handler = WebHttpHandlerBuilder
		.webHandler(RouterFunctions.toHttpHandler(...))
		.applicationContext(context)
		.build(); // (4)
----

The above creates an `AnnotationConfigApplicationContext` instance (1) that can take advantage
of the new functional bean registration API (2) to register beans using a Java 8 `Supplier`
or just by specifying its class (3). The `HttpHandler` is created using `WebHttpHandlerBuilder` (4).

**Common to both** annotation and functional flavors, an `HttpHandler` can then be installed in each supported runtime:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
// Tomcat and Jetty (also see notes below)
HttpServlet servlet = new ServletHttpHandlerAdapter(handler);
...

// Reactor Netty
ReactorHttpHandlerAdapter adapter = new ReactorHttpHandlerAdapter(handler);
HttpServer.create(host, port)
		.newHandler(adapter)
		.doOnNext(c -> System.out.println("Server listening on " + c.address())).block()
		.onClose().block();

// RxNetty
RxNettyHttpHandlerAdapter adapter = new RxNettyHttpHandlerAdapter(handler);
HttpServer server = HttpServer.newServer(new InetSocketAddress(host, port));
server.startAndAwait(adapter);

// Undertow
UndertowHttpHandlerAdapter adapter = new UndertowHttpHandlerAdapter(handler);
Undertow server = Undertow.builder().addHttpListener(port, host).setHandler(adapter).build();
server.start();
----

[NOTE]
====
For Servlet runtimes you can use the `AbstractAnnotationConfigDispatcherHandlerInitializer`,
which as a `WebApplicationInitializer` is auto-detected by Servlet containers
and it registers for you the `ServletHttpHandlerAdapter` shown above.
Only implement one method to point to your Spring Java configuration classes.
