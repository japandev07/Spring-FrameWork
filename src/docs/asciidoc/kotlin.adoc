== Introduction

https://kotlinlang.org[Kotlin] is a statically-typed language targeting the JVM which allows to write concise and elegant
code while providing a very good https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html[interoperability] with libraries
written in Java.

Spring Framework 5 introduces first-class support for Kotlin in order to allow developers to write Spring + Kotlin
application almost like if Spring Framework was a native Kotlin framework.

== Requirements ==

Spring Framework 5 supports Kotlin 1.1+ and requires both `kotlin-stdlib` (or one of its variants
`kotlin-stdlib-jre7` or `kotlin-stdlib-jre8`) and `kotlin-reflects` to be present on the classpath.
They are provided by default if you bootstrap a Kotlin project on
https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin[start.spring.io].

== Kotlin extensions for Spring API

Thanks to its great https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/java-interop.html[Java interoperability]
and https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/extensions.html[Kotlin extensions], Spring
Framework 5 Kotlin API is leveraging the Java's one, completed by a few Kotlin specific API
available out of the box from Spring Framework JARs.

{doc-root}/spring-framework/docs/{spring-version}/kdoc-api/spring-framework/[Spring Framework KDoc API] lists
and documents all Kotlin extensions and DSL available.

[NOTE]
====
Keep in mind that Kotlin extensions need to be imported to be use. That means for example that
`GenericApplicationContext.registerBean` Kotlin extensions will be available only if you write
`import org.springframework.context.support.registerBean`. That said, like with static imports,
IDEs should automatically suggest them in most cases.
====

For example, https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/inline-functions.html#reified-type-parameters[Kotlin reified type parameters]
provide a workaround for JVM https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/erasure.html[generics type erasure],
so Spring Framework 5 introduces some extensions to take advantage of this feature to provide a better API when possible.
That allows to provide convenient API for `RestTemplate`, for the new `WebClient` from Spring WebFlux
and for various other API.

To retrieve a list of `Foo` objects in Java you have to write:

[source,java]
----
Flux<User> users  = client.get().retrieve().bodyToFlux(User.class)
----

While in Kotlin with Spring Framework extensions, you are able to write:

[source,kotlin]
----
val users = client.get().retrieve().bodyToFlux<User>()
// or (both are equivalent)
val users : Flux<User> = client.get().retrieve().bodyToFlux()
----

Like in Java, `users` in Kotlin is strongly typed but Kotlin clever type inference allows shorter syntax.


[NOTE]
====
Other libraries like Reactor or Spring Data also provide Kotlin extensions for their API
in order to allow a better Kotlin development experience.
====

== Null-safety of Spring API

One of Kotlin's key features is https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html[null-safety] which allows to deal with
`null` values at compile time rather than bumping into the famous `NullPointerException` at runtime. This makes your applications
safer through clean nullability declarations, expressing "value or no value" semantics without paying the cost of wrapper like `Optional`.
(Kotlin allows using functional constructs with nullable values; check out this
http://www.baeldung.com/kotlin-null-safety[comprehensive guide to Kotlin null-safety].)

Although Java does not allow to express null-safety in its type-system, Spring Framework 5 introduces
https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-15540[null-safety of the whole Spring Framework APIs] via tooling-friendly annotations:

 * `@NonNullApi` annotations at package level declare that non-null is the default behavior
 * `@Nullable` annotations where specific parameters or return values can be `null`.

Both annotations are meta-annotated with https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=305[JSR 305] meta-annotations (a dormant JSR but supported by tools
like IDEA, Eclipse, Findbugs, etc.) to provide useful warnings to Java developers.

On the Kotlin side - as of the https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/08/kotlin-1-1-4-is-out/[Kotlin 1.1.4 release] -
these annotations https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/jsr-305/proposals/jsr-305-custom-nullability-qualifiers.md[are recognized by Kotlin]
in order to provide null-safety for the whole Spring API. That means you should never have `NullPointerException` in your code when
using Spring 5 and Kotlin because the compiler will not allow it.

For now, you need to use a `-Xjsr305-annotations=enable` flag (specified via the `freeCompilerArgs` peroperty with Maven or Gradle Kotlin
plugin), but that will became the default behavior in an upcoming release of Kotlin.

Make sure to https://github.com/sdeleuze/spring-kotlin-functional/blob/2d6ac07adfc2b8f25e91681dbb2b58a1c6cdf9a7/build.gradle.kts#L57[include JSR-305 JAR]
until Kotlin 1.1.5 is released (it will include https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-19419[KT-19419] fix).

Currently null-safety does not apply to generic type parameters, but that could change in the future, the related issue is
https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-19592[KT-19592].

[NOTE]
====
Other libraries like Reactor or Spring Data leverage these annotations to provide
null-safe APIs for Kotlin developers.
====

== Support for Kotlin classes

Spring Framework 5 now supports various Kotlin constructs like instantiating Kotlin classes
via primary constructors, immutable classes data binding and optional parameters with default values.

== Leveraging Kotlin nullable information in Spring annotations

Spring Framework also takes advantage of https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/null-safety.html[Kotlin null-safety support]
to determine if an HTTP parameter is required without having to define explicitly the `required` attribute.
That means `@RequestParam name: String?` with be treated as not required and `@RequestParam name: String` as required.

This is also supported on Spring Messaging `@Header` annotation.

In a similar fashion, Spring bean injection with `@Autowired` or `@Inject` uses this information to know if a bean is required or not.
`@Autowired lateinit var foo: Foo` implies that a bean of type `Foo` must be registered in the application context while
`@Autowired lateinit var foo: Foo?` wonâ€™t raise an error if such bean does not exist.

== Spring WebFlux functional DSL

Spring Framework 5.0 comes with a {doc-root}/spring-framework/docs/{spring-version}/kdoc-api/spring-framework/org.springframework.web.reactive.function.server/-router-function-dsl/[Kotlin routing DSL] that allows you to leverage the
<<webflux-fn,WebFlux functional API] with clean and idiomatic Kotlin code:

[source,kotlin]
----
router {
  accept(TEXT_HTML).nest {
    GET("/") { ok().render("index") }
    GET("/sse") { ok().render("sse") }
    GET("/users", userHandler::findAllView)
  }
  "/api".nest {
    accept(APPLICATION_JSON).nest {
      GET("/users", userHandler::findAll)
    }
    accept(TEXT_EVENT_STREAM).nest {
      GET("/users", userHandler::stream)
    }
  }
  resources("/**", ClassPathResource("static/"))
}
----

[NOTE]
====
This DSL is programmatic, thus also allows custom registration logic of beans via `if` expression,
`for` loop or any other Kotlin constructs. That can be useful when routes need to be registered
depending on dynamic data, for example created via the backoffice.
====


== Functional bean declaration DSL

Spring Framework 5.0 introduces a new way to register beans using lambda as an alternative
to XML or JavaConfig with `@Configuration` and `@Bean`. In a nutshell, it makes it possible
to register beans with a `Supplier` lambda that acts as a `FactoryBean`.  It is very efficient
and does not require any reflection or CGLIB proxies.

In Java you will for example write:

[source,java]
----
GenericApplicationContext context = new GenericApplicationContext();
context.registerBean(Foo.class);
context.registerBean(Bar.class, () -> new
	Bar(context.getBean(Foo.class))
);
----

While in Kotlin, reified type parameters and `GenericApplicationContext` Kotlin extensions allows to simply write:

[source,kotlin]
----
val context = GenericApplicationContext().apply {
    registerBean<Foo>()
    registerBean { Bar(it.getBean<Foo>()) }
}
----

A {doc-root}/spring-framework/docs/{spring-version}/kdoc-api/spring-framework/org.springframework.context.support/-bean-definition-dsl/[dedicated DSL]
is provided in order to allow an fully idiomatic syntax. It conceptually declares a
`Consumer&lt;GenericApplicationContext&gt;` via a clean declarative API which allows you
to deal with profile and `Environment` for customizing how your beans are registered.

[source,kotlin]
----
beans {
  bean<UserHandler>()
  bean {
    Routes(ref(), ref())
  }
  bean<WebHandler>("webHandler") {
    RouterFunctions.toWebHandler(
      ref<Routes>().router(),
      HandlerStrategies.builder().viewResolver(ref()).build()
    )
  }
  bean("messageSource") {
    ReloadableResourceBundleMessageSource().apply {
      setBasename("messages")
      setDefaultEncoding("UTF-8")
    }
  }
  bean {
    val prefix = "classpath:/templates/"
    val suffix = ".mustache"
    val loader = MustacheResourceTemplateLoader(prefix, suffix)
    MustacheViewResolver(Mustache.compiler().withLoader(loader)).apply {
      setPrefix(prefix)
      setSuffix(suffix)
    }
  }
  profile("foo") {
    bean<Foo>()
  }
}
----

`Routes(ref(), ref())` is the equivalent of `Routes(ref&lt;UserHandler&gt;(), ref&lt;MessageSource&gt;())`
(types are not required thanks to Kotlin type inference) where `ref&lt;UserHandler&gt;()`
is a shortcut for `applicationContext.getBean(UserHandler::class.java)`.

[NOTE]
====
This DSL is programmatic, thus also allows custom registration logic of beans via `if` expression,
`for` loop or any other Kotlin constructs.
====

== Kotlin Script based templates

As of version 4.3, Spring Framework provides a
http://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/view/script/ScriptTemplateView.html[ScriptTemplateView]
to render templates using script engines that supports https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=223[JSR-223]
and Spring Framework 5.0 go even further by extending this feature to WebFlux and supporting
https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-15064[i18n and nested templates].

Kotlin 1.1 provides such support and allows to render Kotlin based templates, see
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/badde3a479a53e1dd0777dd1bd5b55cb1021cf9e[this commit] for details.

This enables some interesting use cases like writing type-safe templates using
https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlinx.html[kotlinx.html] DSL or simply Kotlin multiline `String` with interpolation.

This can allow you to write this kind of templates with full autocompletion and refactoring support in your IDE:

[source,kotlin]
----
import io.spring.demo.*

"""
${include("header")}
<h1>${i18n("title")}</h1>
<ul>
    ${users.joinToLine{ "<li>${i18n("user")} ${it.firstname} ${it.lastname}</li>" }}
</ul>
${include("footer")}
"""
----

See https://github.com/sdeleuze/kotlin-script-templating[kotlin-script-templating] example
project for more details.

== Getting started

The easiest way to start a new Spring Framework 5 project in Kotlin is to create a new Spring
Boot 2 project on https://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin[start.spring.io].

It is also possible to create a standalone WebFlux project as described in
https://spring.io/blog/2017/08/01/spring-framework-5-kotlin-apis-the-functional-way[this blog post].

=== Choose you web flavor

Spring Framework now comes with 2 different web stacks: Spring MVC and WebFlux.

Spring WebFlux is recommended if you want to create applications that will deal with latency,
long-lived connections, streaming scenarios or simply if you want to use the web functional
Kotlin DSL.

For other use cases, Spring MVC and its annotation-based programming model is a perfectly
valid and fully supported choice.

=== Classes and member functions final by default

By default, https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/classes-final-by-default/166[call classes in Kotlin are `final`].
The `open` annotation on a class is the opposite of Java's `final`: it allows others to
inherit from this class. Same for member functions that need to be open to be overridden.

While Kotlin JVM-friendly design is generally a good fit with Spring, this specific point
can prevent your application to start if not taken in account because Spring beans proxified
with CGLIB - like `@Configuration` classes - need to be inherited at runtime for technical
reasons.

Before Kotlin 1.0.6, you needed to add an `open` keyword on each class and their member
functions of Spring beans proxified with CGLIB like `@Configuration` classes.

Fortunately, Kotlin 1.0.6+ now provides a
https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/compiler-plugins.html#kotlin-spring-compiler-plugin[`kotlin-spring`]
plugin that open classes and their member functions by default for classes annotated or meta-annotated with one of the following annotation:

* `@Component`
* `@Async`
* `@Transactional`
* `@Cacheable`

Meta-annotations support means that classes annotated with`@Configuration`, `@Controller`,
`@RestController`, `@Service` or `@Repository` are automatically opened since these
annotations are meta-annotated with `@Component`.

http://start.spring.io/#!language=kotlin[start.spring.io] enables it by default.

=== What is the recommended way to inject dependencies in Kotlin?

Try to favor constructor injection with `val` properties. As of Spring Framework 4.3, you
just have to write `class MessageController(val repository: MessageService)` and Spring will automatically
autowire the constructor.

If you really need to use field injection, use `lateinit var`:

[source,kotlin]
----
@Component
class YourBean {

    @Autowired
    lateinit var mongoTemplate: MongoTemplate

    @Autowired
    lateinit var solrClient: SolrClient
}
----

=== Easy testing Kotlin and JUnit 5

Kotlin allows to specify meaningful test function names betweeen backticks,
and as of JUnit 5.0 Kotlin test classes can use `@TestInstance(TestInstance.Lifecycle.PER_CLASS)`
to enable a single instantiation of test classes which allows to use `@BeforeAll` and `@AfterAll`
annotations on non-static methods, which is a good fit for Kotlin.

It is also now possible to change the default behavior to `PER_CLASS` thanks to a
`junit-platform.properties` file with a
`junit.jupiter.testinstance.lifecycle.default = per_class` property.

[source]
----
class IntegrationTests {

  val application = Application(8181)
  val client = WebClient.create("http://localhost:8181")

  @BeforeAll
  fun beforeAll() {
    application.start()
  }

  @Test
  fun `Find all users on HTML page`() {
    client.get().uri("/users")
        .accept(TEXT_HTML)
        .retrieve()
        .bodyToMono<String>()
        .test()
        .expectNextMatches { it.contains("Foo") }
        .verifyComplete()
  }

  @AfterAll
  fun afterAll() {
    application.stop()
  }
}
----
