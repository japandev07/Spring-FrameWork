This part of the documentation covers support for web applications designed to run on a
reactive web stack (Reactive Streams API + non-blocking runtime) using <<webflux-module, Spring WebFlux>>,
including its <<webflux-fn,functional programming model>>.

=== What is Reactive Programming?

In plain terms reactive programming is about non-blocking applications that are asynchronous
and event-driven and require a small number of threads to scale vertically (i.e. within the
JVM) rather than horizontally (i.e. through clustering).

A key aspect of reactive applications is the concept of backpressure which is
a mechanism to ensure producers don't overwhelm consumers. For example in a pipeline
of reactive components extending from the database to the HTTP response when the
HTTP connection is too slow the data repository can also slow down or stop completely
until network capacity frees up.

Reactive programming also leads to a major shift from imperative to declarative async
composition of logic. It is comparable to writing blocking code vs using the
`CompletableFuture` from Java 8 to compose follow-up actions via lambda expressions.

=== Reactive API and Building Blocks

Spring Framework 5 embraces
https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm#reactive-streams[Reactive Streams]
as the contract for communicating backpressure across async components and
libraries. Reactive Streams is a specification created through industry collaboration that
has also been adopted in Java 9 as `java.util.concurrent.Flow`.

The Spring Framework uses https://projectreactor.io/[Reactor] internally for its own
reactive support. Reactor is a Reactive Streams implementation that further extends the
basic Reactive Streams `Publisher` contract with the `Flux` and `Mono` composable API
types to provide declarative operations on data sequences of `0..N` and `0..1`.

The Spring Framework exposes `Flux` and `Mono` in many of its own reactive APIs.
At the application level however, as always, Spring provides choice and fully supports
the use of RxJava. For more on reactive types check the post
