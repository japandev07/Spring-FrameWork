[[webflux-introduction]]
== Introduction
The original web framework included in the Spring Framework, Spring Web MVC, was purpose
built for the Servlet API and Servlet containers. The reactive stack, web framework,
Spring WebFlux, was added later in version 5.0. It is fully non-blocking, supports
http://www.reactive-streams.org/[Reactive Streams] back pressure, and runs on servers such as
Netty, Undertow, and Servlet 3.1+ containers.

Both web frameworks mirror the names of their source modules
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/master/spring-webmvc[spring-webmvc] and
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/tree/master/spring-webflux[spring-webflux]
and co-exist side by side in the Spring Framework. Each module is optional.
Applications may use one or the other module, or in some cases both --
e.g. Spring MVC controllers with the reactive `WebClient`.



[[webflux-new-framework]]
=== Why a new web framework?

Part of the answer is the need for a non-blocking web stack to handle concurrency with a
small number of threads and scale with less hardware resources. Servlet 3.1 did provide
an API for non-blocking I/O. However, using it leads away from the rest of the Servlet API
where contracts are synchronous (`Filter`, `Servlet`) or blocking (`getParameter`,
`getPart`). This was the motivation for a new common API to serve as a foundation across
any non-blocking runtime. That is important because of servers such as Netty that are well
established in the async, non-blocking space.

The other part of the answer is functional programming. Much like the addition of annotations
in Java 5 created opportunities -- e.g. annotated REST controllers or unit tests, the addition
of lambda expressions in Java 8 created opportunities for functional APIs in Java.
This is a boon for non-blocking applications and continuation style APIs -- as popularized
by `CompletableFuture` and http://reactivex.io/[ReactiveX], that allow declarative
composition of asynchronous logic. At the programming model level Java 8 enabled Spring
WebFlux to offer functional web endpoints alongside with annotated controllers.



[[webflux-why-reactive]]
=== Reactive: what and why?

We touched on non-blocking and functional but why reactive and what do we mean?

The term "reactive" refers to programming models that are built around reacting to change --
network component reacting to I/O events, UI controller reacting to mouse events, etc.
In that sense non-blocking is reactive because instead of being blocked we are now in the mode
of reacting to notifications as operations complete or data becomes available.

There is also another important mechanism that we on the Spring team associate with "reactive"
and that is non-blocking back pressure. In synchronous, imperative code, blocking calls
serve as a natural form of back pressure that forces the caller to wait. In non-blocking
code it becomes important to control the rate of events so that a fast producer does not
overwhelm its destination.

Reactive Streams is a
https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams-jvm/blob/v1.0.1/README.md#specification[small spec],
also http://download.java.net/java/jdk9/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Flow.html[adopted] in Java 9,
that defines the interaction between asynchronous components with back pressure.
For example a data repository -- acting as
http://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.1-javadoc/org/reactivestreams/Publisher.html[Publisher],
can produce data that an HTTP server -- acting as
http://www.reactive-streams.org/reactive-streams-1.0.1-javadoc/org/reactivestreams/Subscriber.html[Subscriber],
can then write to the response. The main purpose of Reactive Streams is to allow the
subscriber to control how fast or how slow the publisher will produce data.

[NOTE]
====
*Common question: what if a publisher can't slow down?* +
The purpose of Reactive Streams is only to establish the mechanism and a boundary.
If a publisher can't slow down then it has to decide whether to buffer, drop, or fail.
====



[[webflux-reactive-api]]
=== Reactive API

Reactive Streams plays an important role for interoperability. It is of interest to libraries
and infrastructure components but less useful as an application API because it is too
low level. What applications need is a higher level and richer, functional API to
compose async logic -- similar to the Java 8 `Stream` API but not only for collections.
This is the role that reactive libraries play.

https://github.com/reactor/reactor[Reactor] is the reactive library of choice for
Spring WebFlux. It provides the
https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Mono.html[Mono] and
https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html[Flux] API types
to work on data sequences of 0..1 and 0..N through a rich set of operators aligned with the
ReactiveX http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html[vocabulary of operators].
Reactor is a Reactive Streams library and therefore all of its operators support non-blocking back pressure.
Reactor has a strong focus on server-side Java. It is developed in close collaboration
with Spring.

WebFlux requires Reactor as a core dependency but it is interoperable with other reactive
libraries via Reactive Streams. As a general rule WebFlux APIs accept a plain `Publisher`
as input, adapt it to Reactor types internally, use those, and then return either
`Flux` or `Mono` as output. So you can pass any `Publisher` as input and you can apply
operations on the output, but you'll need to adapt the output for use with another reactive library.
Whenever feasible -- e.g. annotated controllers, WebFlux adapts transparently to the use
of RxJava or other reactive library. See <<webflux-reactive-libraries>> for more details.



[[webflux-programming-models]]
=== Programming models

The `spring-web` module contains the reactive foundation that underlies Spring WebFlux
including HTTP abstractions, Reactive Streams <<webflux-httphandler,adapters>> for supported
servers, <<webflux-codecs,codecs>>, and a core <<webflux-web-handler-api>> comparable to
the Servlet API but with non-blocking contracts.

On that foundation Spring WebFlux provides a choice of two programming models:

- <<webflux-controller>> -- consistent with Spring MVC, and based on the same annotations
from the `spring-web` module. Both Spring MVC and WebFlux controllers support reactive
(Reactor, RxJava) return types and as a result it is not easy to tell them apart. One notable
difference is that WebFlux also supports reactive `@RequestBody` arguments.
- <<webflux-fn>> -- lambda-based, lightweight, functional programming model. Think of
this as a small library or a set of utilities that an application can use to route and
handle requests. The big difference with annotated controllers is that the application
is in charge of request handling from start to finish vs declaring intent through
annotations and being called back.



[[webflux-framework-choice]]
=== Choosing a web framework

Should you use Spring MVC or WebFlux? Let's cover a few different perspectives.

If you have a Spring MVC application that works fine, there is no need to change.
Imperative programming is the easiest way to write, understand, and debug code.
You have maximum choice of libraries since historically most are blocking.

If you are already shopping for a non-blocking web stack, Spring WebFlux offers the same
execution model benefits as others in this space and also provides a choice of servers --
Netty, Tomcat, Jetty, Undertow, Servlet 3.1+ containers, a choice of programming models --
annotated controllers and functional web endpoints, and a choice of reactive libraries --
Reactor, RxJava, or other.

If you are interested in a lightweight, functional web framework for use with Java 8 lambdas
or Kotlin then use the Spring WebFlux functional web endpoints. That can also be a good choice
for smaller applications or microservices with less complex requirements that can benefit
from greater transparency and control.

In a microservice architecture you can have a mix of applications with either Spring MVC
or Spring WebFlux controllers, or with Spring WebFlux functional endpoints. Having support
for the same annotation-based programming model in both frameworks makes it easier to
re-use knowledge while also selecting the right tool for the right job.

A simple way to evaluate an application is to check its dependencies. If you have blocking
persistence APIs (JPA, JDBC), or networking APIs to use, then Spring MVC is the best choice
for common architectures at least. It is technically feasible with both Reactor and
RxJava to perform blocking calls on a separate thread but you wouldn't be making the
most of a non-blocking web stack.

If you have a Spring MVC application with calls to remote services, try the reactive `WebClient`.
You can return reactive types (Reactor, RxJava, <<webflux-reactive-libraries,or other>>)
directly from Spring MVC controller methods. The greater the latency per call, or the
interdependency among calls, the more dramatic the benefits. Spring MVC controllers
can call other reactive components too.

If you have a large team, keep in mind the steep learning curve in the shift to non-blocking,
functional, and declarative programming. A practical way to start without a full switch
is to use the reactive `WebClient`. Beyond that start small and measure the benefits.
We expect that for a wide range of applications the shift is unnecessary.

If you are unsure what benefits to look for, start by learning about how non-blocking I/O
works (e.g. concurrency on single-threaded Node.js is not an oxymoron) and its effects.
The tag line is "scale with less hardware" but that effect is not guaranteed, not without
some network I/O that can be slow or unpredictable. This Netflix
https://medium.com/netflix-techblog/zuul-2-the-netflix-journey-to-asynchronous-non-blocking-systems-45947377fb5c[blog post]
is a good resource.



[[webflux-server-choice]]
=== Choosing a server

Spring WebFlux is supported on Netty, Undertow, Tomcat, Jetty, and Servlet 3.1+ containers.
Each server is adapted to a common Reactive Streams API. The Spring WebFlux programming
models are built on that common API.

[NOTE]
====
*Common question: how can Tomcat and Jetty be used in both stacks?* +
Tomcat and Jetty are non-blocking at their core. It's the Servlet API that adds a
blocking facade. Starting in version 3.1 the Servlet API adds a choice for non-blocking I/O.
However its use requires care to avoid other synchronous and blocking parts. For this
reason Spring's reactive web stack has a low-level Servlet adapter to bridge to Reactive
Streams but the Servlet API is otherwise not exposed for direct use.
====

Spring Boot 2 uses Netty by default with WebFlux because Netty is more widely used in the
async, non-blocking space and also provides both client and server that can share resources.
By comparison Servlet 3.1 non-blocking I/O hasn't seen much use because the bar to use it
is so high. Spring WebFlux opens one practical path to adoption.

The default server choice in Spring Boot is mainly about the out-of-the-box experience.
Applications can still choose any of the other supported servers which are also highly
optimized for performance, fully non-blocking, and adapted to Reactive Streams back
pressure. In Spring Boot it is trivial to make the switch.



[[webflux-performance]]
=== Performance vs scale

Performance has many characteristics and meanings. Reactive and non-blocking generally
do not make applications run faster. They can, in some cases, for example if using the
`WebClient` to execute remote calls in parallel. On the whole it requires more work to do
things the non-blocking way and that can increase slightly the required processing time.

The key expected benefit of reactive and non-blocking is the ability to scale with a small,
fixed number of threads and less memory. That makes applications more resilient under load
because they scale in a more predictable way. In order to observe those benefits however you
need to have some latency including a mix of slow and unpredictable network I/O.
That's where the reactive stack begins to show its strengths and the differences can be
dramatic.




[[webflux-reactive-spring-web]]
== Reactive Spring Web

The `spring-web` module provides low level infrastructure and HTTP abstractions -- client
and server, to build reactive web applications. All public APIs are build around Reactive
Streams with Reactor as a backing implementation.

Server support is organized in two layers:

* <<webflux-httphandler,HttpHandler>> and server adapters -- the most basic, common API
for HTTP request handling with Reactive Streams back pressure.
* <<webflux-web-handler-api,WebHandler API>> -- slightly higher level but still general
purpose server web API with filter chain style processing.



[[webflux-httphandler]]
=== HttpHandler

Every HTTP server has some API for HTTP request handling.
{api-spring-framework}/http/server/reactive/HttpHandler.html[HttpHandler]
is a simple contract with one method to handle a request and response.
It is intentionally minimal. Its main purpose is to provide a common, Reactive Streams
based API for HTTP request handling over different servers.

The `spring-web` module contains adapters for every supported server. The table below shows
the server APIs are used and where Reactive Streams support comes from:

{api-spring-framework}/web/server/adapter/AbstractReactiveWebInitializer.html[AbstractReactiveWebInitializer].
====



[[webflux-web-handler-api]]
=== WebHandler API

`HttpHandler` is the lowest level contract for running on different HTTP servers.
On top of that foundation, the WebHandler API provides a slightly higher level, but
still general purpose, set of components that form a chain of
{api-spring-framework}/web/server/WebExceptionHandler.html[WebExceptionHandler's],
{api-spring-framework}/web/server/WebFilter.html[WebFilter's], and a
{api-spring-framework}/web/server/WebHandler.html[WebHandler].

All WebHandler API components take `ServerWebExchange` as input which goes beyond
`ServerHttpRequest` and `ServerHttpResponse` to provide extra building blocks for
use in web applications such as request attributes, session attributes, access to parsed
form data, multipart data, and more.

`WebHttpHandlerBuilder` is used to assemble a request processing chain. You can use
methods on the builder to add components manually, or more likely have them detected from
a Spring `ApplicationContext`, with the resulting `HttpHandler` ready to run via a
<<webflux-httphandler,server adapter>>:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
ApplicationContext context = ...
HttpHandler handler = WebHttpHandlerBuilder.applicationContext(context).build()
----



[[webflux-web-handler-api-special-beans]]
==== Special bean types

The table below lists the components that `WebHttpHandlerBuilder` detects:

[cols="2,2,1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Bean name|Bean type|Count|Description

|<any>
|`WebExceptionHandler`
|0..N
|Exception handlers to apply after all ``WebFilter``'s and the target `WebHandler`.

|<any>
|`WebFilter`
|0..N
|Filters to invoke before and after the target `WebHandler`.

|"webHandler"
|`WebHandler`
|1
|The handler for the request.

|"webSessionManager"
|`WebSessionManager`
|0..1
|The manager for ``WebSession``'s exposed through a method on `ServerWebExchange`.

`DefaultWebSessionManager` by default.

|"serverCodecConfigurer"
|`ServerCodecConfigurer`
|0..1
|For access to ``HttpMessageReader``'s for parsing form data and multipart data that's
then exposed through methods on `ServerWebExchange`.

`ServerCodecConfigurer.create()` by default.

|"localeContextResolver"
|`LocaleContextResolver`
|0..1
|The resolver for `LocaleContext` exposed through a method on `ServerWebExchange`.

`AcceptHeaderLocaleContextResolver` by default.
|===


[[webflux-form-data]]
==== Form data

`ServerWebExchange` exposes the following method for access to form data:
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
Mono<MultiValueMap<String, String>> getFormData();
----

The `DefaultServerWebExchange` uses the configured `HttpMessageReader` to parse form data
("application/x-www-form-urlencoded") into a `MultiValueMap`. By default
`FormHttpMessageReader` is configured for use via the `ServerCodecConfigurer` bean
(see <<webflux-web-handler-api,Web Handler API>>).


[[webflux-multipart]]
==== Multipart data
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-multipart,Same in Spring MVC>>#

`ServerWebExchange` exposes the following method for access to multipart data:
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
Mono<MultiValueMap<String, Part>> getMultipartData();
----

The `DefaultServerWebExchange` uses the configured
`HttpMessageReader<MultiValueMap<String, Part>>` to parse "multipart/form-data" content
into a `MultiValueMap`. At present
https://github.com/synchronoss/nio-multipart[Synchronoss NIO Multipart] is the only 3rd
party library supported, and the only library we know for non-blocking parsing of
multipart requests. It is enabled through the `ServerCodecConfigurer` bean
(see <<webflux-web-handler-api,Web Handler API>>).

To parse multipart data in streaming fashion, use the `Flux<Part>` returned from an
`HttpMessageReader<Part>` instead. For example in an annotated controller use of
`@RequestPart` implies Map-like access to individual parts by name, and hence requires
parsing multipart data in full. By contrast `@RequestBody` can be used to decode the
content to `Flux<Part>` without collecting to a `MultiValueMap`.



[[webflux-codecs]]
=== HTTP Message Codecs
[.small]#<<integration.adoc#rest-message-conversion,Same in Spring MVC>>#

The `spring-web` module defines the
{api-spring-framework}/http/codec/HttpMessageReader.html[HttpMessageReader] and
{api-spring-framework}/http/codec/HttpMessageWriter.html[HttpMessageWriter] contracts
for encoding and decoding the body of HTTP requests and responses via Rective Streams
``Publisher``'s. These contacts are used on the client side, e.g. in the `WebClient`,
and on the server side, e.g. in annotated controllers and functional endpoints.

The `spring-core` module defines the
{api-spring-framework}/core/codec/Encoder.html[Encoder] and
{api-spring-framework}/core/codec/Decoder.html[Decoder] contracts that are independent of
HTTP and rely on the {api-spring-framework}/core/io/buffer/DataBuffer.html[DataBuffer]
contract that abstracts different byte buffer representations such as the Netty `ByteBuf`
and `java.nio.ByteBuffer` (see <<core#databuffers, Data Buffers and Codecs>>).
An `Encoder` can be wrapped with `EncoderHttpMessageWriter` to be used as an
`HttpMessageWriter` while a `Decoder` can be wrapped with `DecoderHttpMessageReader` to
be used as an `HttpMessageReader`.

The `spring-core` module contains basic `Encoder` and `Decoder` implementations for
`byte[]`, `ByteBuffer`, `DataBuffer`, `Resource`, and `String`. The `spring-web` module
adds ``Encoder``'s and ``Decoder``'s for Jackson JSON, Jackson Smile, and JAXB2.
The `spring-web` module also contains some web-specific readers and writers for
server-sent events, form data, and multipart requests.

To configure or customize the readers and writers to use applications will typically use
`ClientCodecConfigurer` or `ServerCodecConfigurer`.



[[webflux-codecs-jackson]]
==== Jackson

The decoder relies on Jackson's non-blocking, byte array parser to parse a stream of byte
chunks into a `TokenBuffer` stream, which can then be turned into Objects with Jackson's
`ObjectMapper`. JSON and https://github.com/FasterXML/smile-format-specification[Smile]
(binary JSON) data formats are currently supported.

The encoder processes a `Publisher<?>` as follows:

* if the `Publisher` is a `Mono` (i.e. single value), the value is encoded when available.
* if media type is `application/stream+json` for JSON or `application/stream+x-jackson-smile`
  for Smile, each value produced by the `Publisher` is encoded individually (and followed
  by a new line in JSON).
* otherwise all items from the `Publisher` are gathered in with `Flux#collectToList()`
and the resulting collection is encoded as an array.

As a special case to the above rules the `ServerSentEventHttpMessageWriter` feeds items
emitted from its input `Publisher` individually into the `Jackson2JsonEncoder` as a
`Mono<?>`.

Note that both the Jackson JSON encoder and decoder explicitly back out of rendering
elements of type `String`. Instead ``String``'s are treated as low level content, (i.e.
serialized JSON) and are rendered as-is by the `CharSequenceEncoder`. If you want a
`Flux<String>` rendered as a JSON array, you'll have to use `Flux#collectToList()` and
provide a `Mono<List<String>>` instead.




[[webflux-dispatcher-handler]]
== DispatcherHandler
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-servlet,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Spring WebFlux, like Spring MVC, is designed around the front controller pattern where a
central `WebHandler`, the `DispatcherHandler`, provides a shared algorithm for request
processing while actual work is performed by configurable, delegate components.
This model is flexible and supports diverse workflows.

`DispatcherHandler` discovers the delegate components it needs from Spring configuration.
It is also designed to be a Spring bean itself and implements `ApplicationContextAware`
for access to the context it runs in. If `DispatcherHandler` is declared with the bean
name "webHandler" it is in turn discovered by
{api-spring-framework}/web/server/adapter/WebHttpHandlerBuilder.html[WebHttpHandlerBuilder]
which puts together a request processing chain as described in
<<webflux-web-handler-api,WebHandler API>>.

Spring configuration in a WebFlux application typically contains:

* `DispatcherHandler` with the bean name "webHandler"
* `WebFilter` and `WebExceptionHandler` beans
* <<webflux-special-bean-types,DispatcherHandler special beans>>
* Others

The configuration is given to `WebHttpHandlerBuilder` to build the processing chain:
[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
ApplicationContext context = ...
HttpHandler handler = WebHttpHandlerBuilder.applicationContext(context);
----

The resulting `HttpHandler` is ready for use with a
<<webflux-httphandler,server adapter>>.



[[webflux-special-bean-types]]
=== Special bean types
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-servlet-special-bean-types,Same in Spring MVC>>#

The `DispatcherHandler` delegates to special beans to process requests and render the
appropriate responses. By "special beans" we mean Spring-managed, Object instances that
implement WebFlux framework contracts. Those usually come with built-in contracts but
you can customize their properties, extend then, or replaced.

The table below lists the special beans detected by the `DispatcherHandler`. Note that
there are also some other beans detected at a lower level, see
<<webflux-web-handler-api-special-beans>> in the Web Handler API.

[[webflux-special-beans-table]]
[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Bean type| Explanation

| HandlerMapping
| Map a request to a handler. The mapping is based on some criteria the details of
  which vary by `HandlerMapping` implementation -- annotated controllers, simple
  URL pattern mappings, etc.

  The main `HandlerMapping` implementations are `RequestMappingHandlerMapping` for
  `@RequestMapping` annotated methods, `RouterFunctionMapping` for functional endpoint
  routes, and `SimpleUrlHandlerMapping` for explicit registrations of URI path patterns
  and ``WebHandler``'s.

| HandlerAdapter
| Help the `DispatcherHandler` to invoke a handler mapped to a request regardless of
  how the handler is actually invoked. For example invoking an annotated controller
  requires resolving annotations. The main purpose of a `HandlerAdapter` is to shield the
  `DispatcherHandler` from such details.

| HandlerResultHandler
| Process the result from the handler invocation and finalize the response.
See <<webflux-resulthandling>>.

|===



[[webflux-framework-config]]
=== WebFlux Config
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-servlet-config,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Applications can declare the infrastructure beans listed under
<<webflux-web-handler-api-special-beans,Web Handler API>> and
<<webflux-special-bean-types,DispatcherHandler>> that are required to process requests.
However in most cases the <<webflux-config>> is the best starting point. It declares the
required beans and provides a higher level configuration callback API to customize it.

[NOTE]
====
Spring Boot relies on the WebFlux config to configure Spring WebFlux and also provides
many extra convenient options.
====



[[webflux-dispatcher-handler-sequence]]
=== Processing
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-servlet-sequence,Same in Spring MVC>>#

The `DispatcherHandler` processes requests as follows:

* Each `HandlerMapping` is asked to find a matching handler and the first match is used.
* If a handler is found, it is executed through an appropriate `HandlerAdapter` which
exposes the return value from the execution as `HandlerResult`.
* The `HandlerResult` is given to an appropriate `HandlerResultHandler` to complete
processing by writing to the response directly or using a view to render.



[[webflux-resulthandling]]
=== Result Handling

When `DispatcherHandler` needs to process the return value from a handler, it finds a
`HandlerResultHandler` that support it and invokes it. The available implementations are
listed below with their default order (all are declared in the <<webflux-config>>):

* `ResponseEntityResultHandler` -- handles `ResponseEntity` return values typically
returned from annotated controllers. The order is set to 0 since it safely matches return
values by type.
* `ServerResponseResultHandler` -- supports `ServerResponse` return values typically
returned from functional endpoints. The order is set to 0 since it safely matches return
values by type.
* `ResponseBodyResultHandler` -- handles return values from `@ResponseBody` methods or
`@RestController` classes. The order is set to 100, i.e. after result handlers that
check for a specific type.
* `ViewResolutionResultHandler` -- performs the <<webflux-viewresolution>> algorithm for
HTML template rendering. The order is set to `Ordered.LOWEST_PRECEDENCE` since it
supports several specific types, e.g. `String`, `Map`, `Rendering`, and others, but will
also treat any other Object as a model attribute. This is why it needs to be last in
the order.



[[webflux-viewresolution]]
=== View Resolution
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-viewresolver,Same in Spring MVC>>#

View resolution enables rendering to a browser with an HTML template and a model without
tying you to a specific view technology. In Spring WebFlux, view resolution is
supported through a dedicated <<webflux-resulthandling,HandlerResultHandler>> that uses
``ViewResolver``'s to map a String, representing a logical view name, to a `View`
instance. The `View` is then used to render the response.


[[webflux-viewresolution-handling]]
==== Handling
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-handling,Same in Spring MVC>>#

The `HandlerResult` passed into `ViewResolutionResultHandler` contains the return value
from the handler, and also the model that contains attributes added during request
handling. The  return value is processed as one of the following:

* `String`, `CharSequence` -- a logical view name to be resolved to a `View` through
the list of configured ``ViewResolver``'s.
* `void` -- select a default view name based on the request path minus the leading and
trailing slash, and resolve it to a `View`. The same also happens when a view name
was not provided, e.g. model attribute was returned, or an async return value, e.g.
`Mono` completed empty.
* {api-spring-framework}/web/reactive/result/view/Rendering.html[Rendering] -- API for
view resolution scenarios; explore the options in your IDE with code completion.
* `Model`, `Map` -- extra model attributes to be added to the model for the request.
* Any other -- any other return value (except for simple types, as determined by
{api-spring-framework}/beans/BeanUtils.html#isSimpleProperty-java.lang.Class-[BeanUtils#isSimpleProperty])
is treated as a model attribute to be added to the model. The attribute name is derived
from the Class name, using {api-spring-framework}/core/Conventions.html[Conventions],
unless a handler method `@ModelAttribute` annotation is present.

The model can contain asynchronous, reactive types (e.g. from Reactor, RxJava). Prior
to rendering, `AbstractView` resolves such model attributes into concrete values
and updates the model. Single-value reactive types are resolved to a single
value, or no value (if empty) while multi-value reactive types, e.g. `Flux<T>` are
collected and resolved to `List<T>`.

To configure view resolution is as simple as adding a `ViewResolutionResultHandler` bean
to your Spring configuration. <<webflux-config-view-resolvers,WebFlux Config>> provides a
dedicated configuration API for view resolution.

See <<webflux-view>> for more on the view technologies integrated with Spring WebFlux.


[[webflux-redirecting-redirect-prefix]]
==== Redirecting
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-redirecting-redirect-prefix,Same in Spring MVC>>#

The special `redirect:` prefix in a view name allows you to perform a redirect. The
`UrlBasedViewResolver` (and sub-classes) recognize this as an instruction that a
redirect is needed. The rest of the view name is the redirect URL.

The net effect is the same as if the controller had returned a `RedirectView` or
`Rendering.redirectTo("abc").build()`, but now the controller itself can simply
operate in terms of logical view names. A view name such as
`redirect:/some/resource` is relative to the current application, while the view name
`redirect:http://example.com/arbitrary/path` redirects to an absolute URL.


[[webflux-multiple-representations]]
==== Content negotiation
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-multiple-representations,Same in Spring MVC>>#

`ViewResolutionResultHandler` supports content negotiation. It compares the request
media type(s) with the media type(s) supported by each selected `View`. The first `View`
that supports the requested media type(s) is used.

In order to support media types such as JSON and XML, Spring WebFlux provides
`HttpMessageWriterView` which is a special `View` that renders through an
<<webflux-codecs,HttpMessageWriter>>. Typically you would configure these as default
views through the <<webflux-config-view-resolvers,WebFlux Config>>. Default views are
always selected and used if they match the requested media type.




[[webflux-controller]]
== Annotated Controllers
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-controller,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Spring WebFlux provides an annotation-based programming model where `@Controller` and
`@RestController` components use annotations to express request mappings, request input,
exception handling, and more. Annotated controllers have flexible method signatures and
do not have to extend base classes nor implement specific interfaces.

Here is a basic example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@RestController
	public class HelloController {

		@GetMapping("/hello")
		public String handle() {
			return "Hello WebFlux";
		}
	}
----

In this example the methods returns a String to be written to the response body.



[[webflux-ann-controller]]
=== @Controller
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-controller,Same in Spring MVC>>#

You can define controller beans using a standard Spring bean definition.
The `@Controller` stereotype allows for auto-detection, aligned with Spring general support
for detecting `@Component` classes in the classpath and auto-registering bean definitions
for them. It also acts as a stereotype for the annotated class, indicating its role as
a web component.

To enable auto-detection of such `@Controller` beans, you can add component scanning to
your Java configuration:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@ComponentScan("org.example.web")
	public class WebConfig {

		// ...
	}
----

`@RestController` is a <<core.adoc#beans-meta-annotations,composed annotation>> that is
itself meta-annotated with `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody` indicating a controller whose
every method inherits the type-level `@ResponseBody` annotation and therefore writes
directly to the response body vs view resolution and rendering with an HTML template.



[[webflux-ann-requestmapping]]
=== Request Mapping
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping,Same in Spring MVC>>#

The `@RequestMapping` annotation is used to map requests to controllers methods. It has
various attributes to match by URL, HTTP method, request parameters, headers, and media
types. It can be used at the class-level to express shared mappings or at the method level
to narrow down to a specific endpoint mapping.

There are also HTTP method specific shortcut variants of `@RequestMapping`:

- `@GetMapping`
- `@PostMapping`
- `@PutMapping`
- `@DeleteMapping`
- `@PatchMapping`

The above are <<webflux-ann-requestmapping-composed>> that are provided out of the box
because arguably most controller methods should be mapped to a specific HTTP method vs
using `@RequestMapping` which by default matches to all HTTP methods. At the same an
`@RequestMapping` is still needed at the class level to express shared mappings.

Below is an example with type and method level mappings:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@RestController
	@RequestMapping("/persons")
	class PersonController {

		@GetMapping("/{id}")
		public Person getPerson(@PathVariable Long id) {
			// ...
		}

		@PostMapping
		@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.CREATED)
		public void add(@RequestBody Person person) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----


[[webflux-ann-requestmapping-uri-templates]]
==== URI Patterns
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-uri-templates,Same in Spring MVC>>#

You can map requests using glob patterns and wildcards:

* `?` matches one character
* `*` matches zero or more characters within a path segment
* `**` match zero or more path segments

You can also declare URI variables and access their values with `@PathVariable`:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping("/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}")
	public Pet findPet(@PathVariable Long ownerId, @PathVariable Long petId) {
		// ...
	}
----

URI variables can be declared at the class and method level:
[source,java,intent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@Controller
@RequestMapping("/owners/{ownerId}")
public class OwnerController {

	@GetMapping("/pets/{petId}")
	public Pet findPet(@PathVariable Long ownerId, @PathVariable Long petId) {
		// ...
	}
}
----

URI variables are automatically converted to the appropriate type or`TypeMismatchException`
is raised. Simple types -- `int`, `long`, `Date`, are supported by default and you can
register support for any other data type.
See <<webflux-ann-typeconversion>> and <<webflux-ann-initbinder>>.

URI variables can be named explicitly -- e.g. `@PathVariable("customId")`, but you can
leave that detail out if the names are the same and your code is compiled with debugging
information or with the `-parameters` compiler flag on Java 8.

The syntax `{*varName}` declares a URI variable that matches zero or more remaining
path segments. For example `/resources/{*path}` matches all files `/resources/` and the
`"path"` variable captures the complete relative path.

The syntax `{varName:regex}` declares a URI variable with a regular expressions with the
syntax `{varName:regex}` -- e.g. given URL `"/spring-web-3.0.5 .jar"`, the below method
extracts the name, version, and file extension:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping("/{name:[a-z-]+}-{version:\\d\\.\\d\\.\\d}{ext:\\.[a-z]+}")
	public void handle(@PathVariable String version, @PathVariable String ext) {
		// ...
	}
----

URI path patterns can also have embedded `${...}` placeholders that are resolved on startup
 via `PropertyPlaceHolderConfigurer` against local, system, environment, and other property
sources. This can be used for example to parameterize a base URL based on some external
configuration.

[NOTE]
====
Spring WebFlux uses `PathPattern` and the `PathPatternParser` for URI path matching support
both of which are located in `spring-web` and expressly designed for use with HTTP URL
paths in web applications where a large number of URI path patterns are matched at runtime.
====

Spring WebFlux does not support suffix pattern matching -- unlike Spring MVC, where a
mapping such as `/person` also matches to `/person.{asterisk}`. For URL based content
negotiation, if needed, we recommend using a query parameter, which is simpler, more
explicit, and less vulnerable to URL path based exploits.


[[webflux-ann-requestmapping-pattern-comparison]]
==== Pattern Comparison
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-pattern-comparison,Same in Spring MVC>>#

When multiple patterns match a URL, they must be compared to find the best match. This is done
with `PathPattern.SPECIFICITY_COMPARATOR` which looks for patterns that more specific.

For every pattern, a score is computed based the number of URI variables and wildcards
where a URI variable scores lower than a wildcard. A pattern with a lower total score
wins. If two patterns have the same score, then the longer is chosen.

Catch-all patterns, e.g. `**`, `{*varName}`, are excluded from the scoring and are always
sorted last instead. If two patterns are both catch-all, the longer is chosen.


[[webflux-ann-requestmapping-consumes]]
==== Consumable Media Types
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-consumes,Same in Spring MVC>>#

You can narrow the request mapping based on the `Content-Type` of the request:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping(path = "/pets", **consumes = "application/json"**)
	public void addPet(@RequestBody Pet pet) {
		// ...
	}
----

The consumes attribute also supports negation expressions -- e.g. `!text/plain` means any
content type other than "text/plain".

You can declare a shared consumes attribute at the class level. Unlike most other request
mapping attributes however when used at the class level, a method-level consumes attribute
overrides rather than extend the class level declaration.

[TIP]
====
`MediaType` provides constants for commonly used media types -- e.g.
`APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE`, `APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE`.
====


[[webflux-ann-requestmapping-produces]]
==== Producible Media Types
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-produces,Same in Spring MVC>>#

You can narrow the request mapping based on the `Accept` request header and the list of
content types that a controller method produces:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping(path = "/pets/{petId}", **produces = "application/json;charset=UTF-8"**)
	@ResponseBody
	public Pet getPet(@PathVariable String petId) {
		// ...
	}
----

The media type can specify a character set. Negated expressions are supported -- e.g.
`!text/plain` means any content type other than "text/plain".

You can declare a shared produces attribute at the class level. Unlike most other request
mapping attributes however when used at the class level, a method-level produces attribute
overrides rather than extend the class level declaration.

[TIP]
====
`MediaType` provides constants for commonly used media types -- e.g.
`APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE`, `APPLICATION_JSON_UTF8_VALUE`.
====


[[webflux-ann-requestmapping-params-and-headers]]
==== Parameters and Headers
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-params-and-headers,Same in Spring MVC>>#

You can narrow request mappings based on query parameter conditions. You can test for the
presence of a query parameter (`"myParam"`), for the absence (`"!myParam"`), or for a
specific value (`"myParam=myValue"`):

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping(path = "/pets/{petId}", **params = "myParam=myValue"**)
	public void findPet(@PathVariable String petId) {
		// ...
	}
----

You can also use the same with request header conditions:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping(path = "/pets", **headers = "myHeader=myValue"**)
	public void findPet(@PathVariable String petId) {
		// ...
	}
----


[[webflux-ann-requestmapping-head-options]]
==== HTTP HEAD, OPTIONS
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-head-options,Same in Spring MVC>>#

`@GetMapping` -- and also `@RequestMapping(method=HttpMethod.GET)`, support HTTP HEAD
transparently for request mapping purposes. Controller methods don't need to change.
A response wrapper, applied in the `HttpHandler` server adapter, ensures a `"Content-Length"`
header is set to the number of bytes written and without actually writing to the response.

By default HTTP OPTIONS is handled by setting the "Allow" response header to the list of HTTP
methods listed in all `@RequestMapping` methods with matching URL patterns.

For a `@RequestMapping` without HTTP method declarations, the "Allow" header is set to
`"GET,HEAD,POST,PUT,PATCH,DELETE,OPTIONS"`. Controller methods should always declare the
supported HTTP methods for example by using the HTTP method specific variants --
`@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.

`@RequestMapping` method can be explicitly mapped to HTTP HEAD and HTTP OPTIONS, but that
is not necessary in the common case.


[[webflux-ann-requestmapping-composed]]
==== Custom Annotations
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestmapping-composed,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Spring WebFlux supports the use of <<core.adoc#beans-meta-annotations,composed annotations>>
for request mapping. Those are annotations that are themselves meta-annotated with
`@RequestMapping` and composed to redeclare a subset (or all) of the `@RequestMapping`
attributes with a narrower, more specific purpose.

`@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, `@PutMapping`, `@DeleteMapping`, and `@PatchMapping` are
examples of composed annotations. They're provided out of the box because arguably most
controller methods should be mapped to a specific HTTP method vs using `@RequestMapping`
which by default matches to all HTTP methods. If you need an example of composed
annotations, look at how those are declared.

Spring WebFlux also supports custom request mapping attributes with custom request matching
logic. This is a more advanced option that requires sub-classing
`RequestMappingHandlerMapping` and overriding the `getCustomMethodCondition` method where
you can check the custom attribute and return your own `RequestCondition`.



[[webflux-ann-methods]]
=== Handler methods
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-methods,Same in Spring MVC>>#

`@RequestMapping` handler methods have a flexible signature and can choose from a range of
supported controller method arguments and return values.


[[webflux-ann-arguments]]
==== Method arguments
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-arguments,Same in Spring MVC>>#

The table below shows supported controller method arguments.

Reactive types (Reactor, RxJava, <<webflux-reactive-libraries,or other>>) are
supported on arguments that require blocking I/O, e.g. reading the request body, to
be resolved. This is marked in the description column. Reactive types are not expected
on arguments that don't require blocking.

JDK 1.8's `java.util.Optional` is supported as a method argument in combination with
annotations that have a `required` attribute -- e.g. `@RequestParam`, `@RequestHeader`,
etc, and is equivalent to `required=false`.

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Controller method argument|Description

|`ServerWebExchange`
|Access to the full `ServerWebExchange` -- container for the HTTP request and response,
request and session attributes, `checkNotModified` methods, and others.

|`ServerHttpRequest`, `ServerHttpResponse`
|Access to the HTTP request or response.

|`WebSession`
|Access to the session; this does not force the start of a new session unless attributes
are added. Supports reactive types.

|`java.security.Principal`
|Currently authenticated user; possibly a specific `Principal` implementation class if known.
Supports reactive types.

|`org.springframework.http.HttpMethod`
|The HTTP method of the request.

 |`java.util.Locale`

Note that use of `@RequestParam` is optional, e.g. to set its attributes.
See "Any other argument" further below in this table.

|`@RequestHeader`
|For access to request headers. Header values are converted to the declared method argument
type. See <<webflux-ann-requestheader>>.

|`@CookieValue`
|For access to cookies. Cookies values are converted to the declared method argument
type. See <<webflux-ann-cookievalue>>.

|`@RequestBody`
|For access to the HTTP request body. Body content is converted to the declared method
argument type using ``HttpMessageReader``'s. Supports reactive types.
<<webflux-ann-requestbody>>.

|`HttpEntity<B>`
|For access to request headers and body. The body is converted with ``HttpMessageReader``'s.
Supports reactive types. See <<webflux-ann-httpentity>>.

|`@RequestPart`
|For access to a part in  a "multipart/form-data" request. Supports reactive types.
See <<webflux-multipart-forms>> and <<webflux-multipart>>.

|`java.util.Map`, `org.springframework.ui.Model`, `org.springframework.ui.ModelMap`
|For access to the model that is used in HTML controllers and exposed to templates as
part of view rendering.

|`@ModelAttribute`
|For access to an existing attribute in the model (instantiated if not present) with
data binding and validation applied. See <<webflux-ann-modelattrib-method-args>> as well
as <<webflux-ann-modelattrib-methods>> and <<webflux-ann-initbinder>>.

Note that use of `@ModelAttribute` is optional, e.g. to set its attributes.
See "Any other argument" further below in this table.

|`Errors`, `BindingResult`
|For access to errors from validation and data binding for a command object
(i.e. `@ModelAttribute` argument), or errors from the validation of an `@RequestBody` or
`@RequestPart` arguments; an `Errors`, or `BindingResult` argument must be declared
immediately after the validated method argument.

|`SessionStatus` + class-level `@SessionAttributes`
|For marking form processing complete which triggers cleanup of session attributes
declared through a class-level `@SessionAttributes` annotation. See
<<webflux-ann-sessionattributes>> for more details.

|`UriComponentsBuilder`
|For preparing a URL relative to the current request's host, port, scheme, context path, and
the literal  part of the servlet mapping also taking into account `Forwarded` and
`X-Forwarded-*` headers.
// See <<webflux-uri-building>>.

|`@SessionAttribute`
|For access to any session attribute; in contrast to model attributes stored in the session
as a result of a class-level `@SessionAttributes` declaration. See
<<webflux-ann-sessionattribute>> for more details.

|`@RequestAttribute`
|For access to request attributes. See <<webflux-ann-requestattrib>> for more details.

|Any other argument
|If a method argument is not matched to any of the above, by default it is resolved as
an `@RequestParam` if it is a simple type, as determined by
{api-spring-framework}/beans/BeanUtils.html#isSimpleProperty-java.lang.Class-[BeanUtils#isSimpleProperty],
or as an `@ModelAttribute` otherwise.
|===


[[webflux-ann-return-types]]
==== Return values
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-return-types,Same in Spring MVC>>#

The table below shows supported controller method return values. Note that reactive types
from libraries such as Reactor, RxJava, <<webflux-reactive-libraries,or other>> are
generally supported for all return values.

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Controller method return value|Description

|`@ResponseBody`
|The return value is encoded through ``HttpMessageWriter``'s and written to the response.
See <<webflux-ann-responsebody>>.

|`HttpEntity<B>`, `ResponseEntity<B>`
|The return value specifies the full response including HTTP headers and body be encoded
through ``HttpMessageWriter``'s and written to the response.
See <<webflux-ann-responseentity>>.

|`HttpHeaders`
|For returning a response with headers and no body.

|`String`
|A view name to be resolved with ``ViewResolver``'s and used together with the implicit
model -- determined through command objects and `@ModelAttribute` methods. The handler
method may also programmatically enrich the model by declaring a `Model` argument (see
above).

|`View`
|A `View` instance to use for rendering together with the implicit model -- determined
through command objects and `@ModelAttribute` methods. The handler method may also
programmatically enrich the model by declaring a `Model` argument (see above).

|`java.util.Map`, `org.springframework.ui.Model`
|Attributes to be added to the implicit model with the view name implicitly determined
based on the request path.

|`@ModelAttribute`
|An attribute to be added to the model with the view name implicitly determined based
on the request path.

Note that `@ModelAttribute` is optional. See "Any other return value" further below in
this table.

|`Rendering`
|An API for model and view rendering scenarios.

|`void`
|A method with a `void`, possibly async (e.g. `Mono<Void>`), return type (or a `null` return
value) is considered to have fully handled the response if it also has a `ServerHttpResponse`,
or a `ServerWebExchange` argument, or an `@ResponseStatus` annotation. The same is true also
if the controller has made a positive ETag or lastModified timestamp check.
// TODO (see <<webflux-caching-etag-lastmodified>> for details)

If none of the above is true, a `void` return type may also indicate "no response body" for
REST controllers, or default view name selection for HTML controllers.

|`Flux<ServerSentEvent>`, `Observable<ServerSentEvent>`, or other reactive type
|Emit server-sent events; the `SeverSentEvent` wrapper can be omitted when only data needs
to be written (however `text/event-stream` must be requested or declared in the mapping
through the produces attribute).

|Any other return value
|If a return value is not matched to any of the above, by default it is treated as a view
name, if it is `String` or `void` (default view name selection applies); or as a model
attribute to be added to the model, unless it is a simple type, as determined by
{api-spring-framework}/beans/BeanUtils.html#isSimpleProperty-java.lang.Class-[BeanUtils#isSimpleProperty]
in which case it remains unresolved.
|===


[[webflux-ann-typeconversion]]
==== Type Conversion
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-typeconversion,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Some annotated controller method arguments that represent String-based request input -- e.g.
`@RequestParam`, `@RequestHeader`, `@PathVariable`, `@MatrixVariable`, and `@CookieValue`,
may require type conversion if the argument is declared as something other than `String`.

For such cases type conversion is automatically applied based on the configured converters.
By default simple types such as `int`, `long`, `Date`, etc. are supported. Type conversion
can be customized through a `WebDataBinder`, see <<mvc-ann-initbinder>>, or by registering
`Formatters` with the `FormattingConversionService`, see
<<core.adoc#format, Spring Field Formatting>>.


[[webflux-ann-matrix-variables]]
==== Matrix variables
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-matrix-variables,Same in Spring MVC>>#

http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-3.3[RFC 3986] discusses name-value pairs in
path segments. In Spring WebFlux we refer to those as "matrix variables" based on an
http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/MatrixURIs.html["old post"] by Tim Berners-Lee but they
can be also be referred to as URI path parameters.

Matrix variables can appear in any path segment, each variable separated by semicolon and
multiple values separated by comma, e.g. `"/cars;color=red,green;year=2012"`. Multiple
values can also be specified through repeated variable names, e.g.
`"color=red;color=green;color=blue"`.

Unlike Spring MVC, in WebFlux the presence or absence of matrix variables in a URL does
not affect request mappings. In other words you're not required to use a URI variable
to mask variable content. That said if you want to access matrix variables from a
controller method you need to add a URI variable to the path segment where matrix
variables are expected. Below is an example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// GET /pets/42;q=11;r=22

	@GetMapping("/pets/{petId}")
	public void findPet(@PathVariable String petId, @MatrixVariable int q) {

		// petId == 42
		// q == 11
	}
----

Given that all path segments may contain matrix variables, sometimes you may need to
disambiguate which path variable the matrix variable is expected to be in.
For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// GET /owners/42;q=11/pets/21;q=22

	@GetMapping("/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}")
	public void findPet(
			@MatrixVariable(name="q", pathVar="ownerId") int q1,
			@MatrixVariable(name="q", pathVar="petId") int q2) {

		// q1 == 11
		// q2 == 22
	}
----

A matrix variable may be defined as optional and a default value specified:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// GET /pets/42

	@GetMapping("/pets/{petId}")
	public void findPet(@MatrixVariable(required=false, defaultValue="1") int q) {

		// q == 1
	}
----

To get all matrix variables, use a `MultiValueMap`:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// GET /owners/42;q=11;r=12/pets/21;q=22;s=23

	@GetMapping("/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}")
	public void findPet(
			@MatrixVariable MultiValueMap<String, String> matrixVars,
			@MatrixVariable(pathVar="petId"") MultiValueMap<String, String> petMatrixVars) {

		// matrixVars: ["q" : [11,22], "r" : 12, "s" : 23]
		// petMatrixVars: ["q" : 22, "s" : 23]
	}
----


[[webflux-ann-requestparam]]
==== @RequestParam
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestparam,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Use the `@RequestParam` annotation to bind query parameters to a method argument in a
controller. The following code snippet shows the usage:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	@RequestMapping("/pets")
	public class EditPetForm {

		// ...

		@GetMapping
		public String setupForm(**@RequestParam("petId") int petId**, Model model) {
			Pet pet = this.clinic.loadPet(petId);
			model.addAttribute("pet", pet);
			return "petForm";
		}

		// ...

	}
----

[TIP]
====
Unlike the Servlet API "request paramater" concept that conflate query parameters, form
data, and multiparts into one, in WebFlux each is accessed individually through the
`ServerWebExchange`. While `@RequestParam` binds to query parameters only, you can
use data binding to apply query paramerters, form data, and multiparts to a
<<webflux-ann-modelattrib-method-args,command object>>.
====

Method parameters using using the `@RequestParam` annotation are required by default, but
you can specify that a method parameter is optional by setting ``@RequestParam``'s
`required` flag to `false` or by declaring the argument with an `java.util.Optional`
wrapper.

Type conversion is applied automatically if the target method parameter type is not
`String`. See <<mvc-ann-typeconversion>>.

When an `@RequestParam` annotation is declared as `Map<String, String>` or
`MultiValueMap<String, String>` argument, the map is populated with all query parameters.

Note that use of `@RequestParam` is optional, e.g. to set its attributes.
By default any argument that is a simple value type, as determined by
{api-spring-framework}/beans/BeanUtils.html#isSimpleProperty-java.lang.Class-[BeanUtils#isSimpleProperty],
and is not resolved by any other argument resolver, is treated as if it was annotated
with `@RequestParam`.


[[webflux-ann-requestheader]]
==== @RequestHeader
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestheader,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Use the `@RequestHeader` annotation to bind a request header to a method argument in a
controller.

Given request with headers:

[literal]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
Host                    localhost:8080
Accept                  text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9
Accept-Language         fr,en-gb;q=0.7,en;q=0.3
Accept-Encoding         gzip,deflate
Accept-Charset          ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7
Keep-Alive              300
----

The following gets the value of the `Accept-Encoding` and `Keep-Alive` headers:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping("/demo")
	public void handle(
			**@RequestHeader("Accept-Encoding")** String encoding,
			**@RequestHeader("Keep-Alive")** long keepAlive) {
		//...
	}
----

Type conversion is applied automatically if the target method parameter type is not
`String`. See <<mvc-ann-typeconversion>>.

When an `@RequestHeader` annotation is used on a `Map<String, String>`,
`MultiValueMap<String, String>`, or `HttpHeaders` argument, the map is populated
with all header values.

[TIP]
====
Built-in support is available for converting a comma-separated string into an
array/collection of strings or other types known to the type conversion system. For
example a method parameter annotated with `@RequestHeader("Accept")` may be of type
`String` but also `String[]` or `List<String>`.

[[webflux-ann-cookievalue]]
==== @CookieValue
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-cookievalue,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Use the `@CookieValue` annotation to bind the value of an HTTP cookie to a method argument
in a controller.

Given request with the following cookie:

[literal]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
JSESSIONID=415A4AC178C59DACE0B2C9CA727CDD84
----

The following code sample demonstrates how to get the cookie value:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping("/demo")
	public void handle(**@CookieValue("JSESSIONID")** String cookie) {
		//...
	}
----

Type conversion is applied automatically if the target method parameter type is not
`String`. See <<mvc-ann-typeconversion>>.


[[webflux-ann-modelattrib-method-args]]
==== @ModelAttribute
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-modelattrib-method-args,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Use the `@ModelAttribute` annotation on a method argument to access an attribute from the
model, or have it instantiated if not present. The model attribute is also overlaid with
values of query parameters and form fields whose names match to field names. This is
referred to as data binding and it saves you from having to deal with parsing and
converting individual query parameters and form fields. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/edit")
	public String processSubmit(**@ModelAttribute Pet pet**) { }
----

The `Pet` instance above is resolved as follows:

* From the model if already added via <<webflux-ann-modelattrib-methods>>.
* From the HTTP session via <<webflux-ann-sessionattributes>>.
* From the invocation of a default constructor.
* From the invocation of a "primary constructor" with arguments matching to query
parameters or form fields; argument names are determined via JavaBeans
`@ConstructorProperties` or via runtime-retained parameter names in the bytecode.

After the model attribute instance is obtained, data binding is applied. The
`WebExchangeDataBinder` class matches names of query parameters and form fields to field
names on the target Object. Matching fields are populated after type conversion is applied
where necessary. For more on data binding (and validation) see
<<core.adoc#validation, Validation>>. For more on customizing data binding see
<<webflux-ann-initbinder>>.

Data binding may result in errors. By default a `WebExchangeBindException` is raised but
to check for such errors in the controller method, add a `BindingResult` argument
immediately next to the `@ModelAttribute` as shown below:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/edit")
	public String processSubmit(**@ModelAttribute("pet") Pet pet**, BindingResult result) {
		if (result.hasErrors()) {
			return "petForm";
		}
		// ...
	}
----

Validation can be applied automatically after data binding by adding the
`javax.validation.Valid` annotation or Spring's `@Validated` annotation (also see
<<core.adoc#validation-beanvalidation, Bean validation>> and
<<core.adoc#validation, Spring validation>>). For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/edit")
	public String processSubmit(**@Valid @ModelAttribute("pet") Pet pet**, BindingResult result) {
		if (result.hasErrors()) {
			return "petForm";
		}
		// ...
	}
----

Spring WebFlux, unlike Spring MVC, supports reactive types in the model, e.g.
`Mono<Account>` or `io.reactivex.Single<Account>`. An `@ModelAttribute` argument can be
declared with or without a reactive type wrapper, and it will be resolved accordingly,
to the actual value if necessary. Note however that in order to use a `BindingResult`
argument, you must declare the `@ModelAttribute` argument before it without a reactive
type wrapper, as shown earlier. Alternatively, you can handle any errors through the
reactive type:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/owners/{ownerId}/pets/{petId}/edit")
	public Mono<String> processSubmit(@Valid @ModelAttribute("pet") Mono<Pet> petMono) {
		return petMono
			.flatMap(pet -> {
				// ...
			})
			.onErrorResume(ex -> {
				// ...
			});
	}
----

Note that use of `@ModelAttribute` is optional, e.g. to set its attributes.
By default any argument that is not a simple value type, as determined by
{api-spring-framework}/beans/BeanUtils.html#isSimpleProperty-java.lang.Class-[BeanUtils#isSimpleProperty],
and is not resolved by any other argument resolver, is treated as if it was annotated
with `@ModelAttribute`.


[[webflux-ann-sessionattributes]]
==== @SessionAttributes
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-sessionattributes,Same in Spring MVC>>#

`@SessionAttributes` is used to store model attributes in the `WebSession` between
requests. It is a type-level annotation that declares session attributes used by a
specific controller. This will typically list the names of model attributes or types of
model attributes which should be transparently stored in the session for subsequent
requests to access.

For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	**@SessionAttributes("pet")**
	public class EditPetForm {
		// ...
	}
----

On the first request when a model attribute with the name "pet" is added to the model,
it is automatically promoted to and saved in the `WebSession`. It remains there until
another controller method uses a `SessionStatus` method argument to clear the storage:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	**@SessionAttributes("pet")**
	public class EditPetForm {

		// ...

		@PostMapping("/pets/{id}")
		public String handle(Pet pet, BindingResult errors, SessionStatus status) {
			if (errors.hasErrors) {
				// ...
			}
				status.setComplete();
				// ...
			}
		}
	}
----


[[webflux-ann-sessionattribute]]
==== @SessionAttribute
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-sessionattribute,Same in Spring MVC>>#

If you need access to pre-existing session attributes that are managed globally,
i.e. outside the controller (e.g. by a filter), and may or may not be present
use the `@SessionAttribute` annotation on a method parameter:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping("/")
	public String handle(**@SessionAttribute** User user) {
		// ...
	}
----

For use cases that require adding or removing session attributes consider injecting
`WebSession` into the controller method.

For temporary storage of model attributes in the session as part of a controller
workflow consider using `SessionAttributes` as described in
<<webflux-ann-sessionattributes>>.


[[webflux-ann-requestattrib]]
==== @RequestAttribute
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestattrib,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Similar to `@SessionAttribute` the `@RequestAttribute` annotation can be used to
access pre-existing request attributes created earlier, e.g. by a `WebFilter`:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping("/")
	public String handle(**@RequestAttribute** Client client) {
		// ...
	}
----


[[webflux-multipart-forms]]
==== Multipart
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-multipart-forms,Same in Spring MVC>>#

As explained in <<webflux-multipart>>, `ServerWebExchange` provides access to multipart
content. The best way to handle a file upload form (e.g. from a browser) in a controller
is through data binding to a <<webflux-ann-modelattrib-method-args,command object>>:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
class MyForm {

	private String name;

	private MultipartFile file;

	// ...

}

@Controller
public class FileUploadController {

	@PostMapping("/form")
	public String handleFormUpload(MyForm form, BindingResult errors) {
		// ...
	}

}
----

Multipart requests can also be submitted from non-browser clients in a RESTful service
scenario. For example a file along with JSON:

[literal]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
POST /someUrl
Content-Type: multipart/mixed

--edt7Tfrdusa7r3lNQc79vXuhIIMlatb7PQg7Vp
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="meta-data"
Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

{
	"name": "value"
}
--edt7Tfrdusa7r3lNQc79vXuhIIMlatb7PQg7Vp
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file-data"; filename="file.properties"
Content-Type: text/xml
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit
... File Data ...
----

You can access the "meta-data" part with `@RequestPart` which would deserialize it from
JSON (similar to `@RequestBody`) through one of the configured <<webflux-codecs>>:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/")
	public String handle(**@RequestPart("meta-data") MetaData metadata,
			@RequestPart("file-data") FilePart file**) {
		// ...
	}
----

To access multipart data sequentially, in streaming fashion, use `@RequestBody` with
`Flux<Part>` instead. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/")
	public String handle(**@RequestBody Flux<Part> parts**) {
		// ...
	}
----

`@RequestPart` can be used in combination with `javax.validation.Valid`, or Spring's
`@Validated` annotation, which causes Standard Bean Validation to be applied.
By default validation errors cause a `WebExchangeBindException` which is turned
into a 400 (BAD_REQUEST) response. Alternatively validation errors can be handled locally
within the controller through an `Errors` or `BindingResult` argument:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
@PostMapping("/")
public String handle(**@Valid** @RequestPart("meta-data") MetaData metadata,
		**BindingResult result**) {
	// ...
}
----


[[webflux-ann-requestbody]]
==== @RequestBody
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-requestbody,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Use the `@RequestBody` annotation to have the request body read and deserialized into an
Object through an <<webflux-codecs,HttpMessageReader>>.
Below is an example with an `@RequestBody` argument:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/accounts")
	public void handle(@RequestBody Account account) {
		// ...
	}
----

Unlike Spring MVC, in WebFlux the `@RequestBody` method argument supports reactive types
and fully non-blocking reading and (client-to-server) streaming:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/accounts")
	public void handle(@RequestBody Mono<Account> account) {
		// ...
	}
----

You can use the <<webflux-config-message-codecs>> option of the <<webflux-config>> to
configure or customize message readers.

`@RequestBody` can be used in combination with `javax.validation.Valid`, or Spring's
`@Validated` annotation, which causes Standard Bean Validation to be applied.
By default validation errors cause a `WebExchangeBindException` which is turned
into a 400 (BAD_REQUEST) response. Alternatively validation errors can be handled locally
within the controller through an `Errors` or `BindingResult` argument:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/accounts")
	public void handle(@Valid @RequestBody Account account, BindingResult result) {
		// ...
	}
----


[[webflux-ann-httpentity]]
==== HttpEntity
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-httpentity,Same in Spring MVC>>#

`HttpEntity` is more or less identical to using <<webflux-ann-requestbody>> but based on a
container object that exposes request headers and body. Below is an example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/accounts")
	public void handle(HttpEntity<Account> entity) {
		// ...
	}
----


[[webflux-ann-responsebody]]
==== @ResponseBody
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-responsebody,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Use the `@ResponseBody` annotation on a method to have the return serialized to the
response body through an <<webflux-codecs,HttpMessageWriter>>. For example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping("/accounts/{id}")
	@ResponseBody
	public Account handle() {
		// ...
	}
----

`@ResponseBody` is also supported at the class level in which case it is inherited by
all controller methods. This is the effect of `@RestController` which is nothing more
than a meta-annotation marked with `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`.

`@ResponseBody` supports reactive types which means you can return Reactor or RxJava
types and have the asynchronous values they produce rendered to the response.
For additional details on JSON rendering see <<webflux-codecs-jackson-json>>.

`@ResponseBody` methods can be combined with JSON serialization views.
See <<mvc-ann-jackson>> for details.

You can use the <<webflux-config-message-codecs>> option of the <<webflux-config>> to
configure or customize message writing.


[[webflux-ann-responseentity]]
==== ResponseEntity
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-responseentity,Same in Spring MVC>>#

`ResponseEntity` is more or less identical to using <<webflux-ann-responsebody>> but based
on a container object that specifies request headers and body. Below is an example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@PostMapping("/something")
	public ResponseEntity<String> handle() {
		// ...
		URI location = ...
		return new ResponseEntity.created(location).build();
	}
----


[[webflux-ann-jackson]]
==== Jackson JSON

[[webflux-ann-jsonview]]
===== Jackson serialization views
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-jackson,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Spring WebFlux provides built-in support for
http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonJsonViews[Jackson's Serialization Views]
which allows rendering only a subset of all fields in an Object. To use it with
`@ResponseBody` or `ResponseEntity` controller methods, use Jackson's
`@JsonView` annotation to activate a serialization view class:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@RestController
	public class UserController {

		@GetMapping("/user")
		@JsonView(User.WithoutPasswordView.class)
		public User getUser() {
			return new User("eric", "7!jd#h23");
		}
	}

	public class User {

		public interface WithoutPasswordView {};
		public interface WithPasswordView extends WithoutPasswordView {};

		private String username;
		private String password;

		public User() {
		}

		public User(String username, String password) {
			this.username = username;
			this.password = password;
		}

		@JsonView(WithoutPasswordView.class)
		public String getUsername() {
			return this.username;
		}

		@JsonView(WithPasswordView.class)
		public String getPassword() {
			return this.password;
		}
	}
----

[NOTE]
====
`@JsonView` allows an array of view classes but you can only specify only one per
controller method. Use a composite interface if you need to activate multiple views.
====



[[webflux-ann-modelattrib-methods]]
=== Model Methods
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-modelattrib-methods,Same in Spring MVC>>#

The `@ModelAttribute` annotation can be used on `@RequestMapping`
<<webflux-ann-modelattrib-method-args,method arguments>> to create or access an Object
from the model and bind it to the request. `@ModelAttribute` can also be used as a
method-level annotation on controller methods whose purpose is not to handle requests
but to add commonly needed model attributes prior to request handling.

A controller can have any number of `@ModelAttribute` methods. All such methods are
invoked before `@RequestMapping` methods in the same controller. A `@ModelAttribute`
method can also be shared across controllers via `@ControllerAdvice`. See the section on
<<webflux-ann-controller-advice>> for more details.

`@ModelAttribute` methods have flexible method signatures. They support many of the same
arguments as `@RequestMapping` methods except for `@ModelAttribute` itself nor anything
related to the request body.

An example `@ModelAttribute` method:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@ModelAttribute
	public void populateModel(@RequestParam String number, Model model) {
		model.addAttribute(accountRepository.findAccount(number));
		// add more ...
	}
----

To add one attribute only:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@ModelAttribute
	public Account addAccount(@RequestParam String number) {
		return accountRepository.findAccount(number);
	}
----

[NOTE]
====
When a name is not explicitly specified, a default name is chosen based on the Object
type as explained in the Javadoc for
{api-spring-framework}/core/Conventions.html[Conventions].
You can always assign an explicit name by using the overloaded `addAttribute` method or
through the name attribute on `@ModelAttribute` (for a return value).
====

Spring WebFlux, unlike Spring MVC, explicitly supports reactive types in the model,
e.g. `Mono<Account>` or `io.reactivex.Single<Account>`. Such asynchronous model
attributes may be transparently resolved (and the model updated) to their actual values
at the time of `@RequestMapping` invocation, providing a `@ModelAttribute` argument is
declared without a wrapper, for example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@ModelAttribute
	public void addAccount(@RequestParam String number) {
	    Mono<Account> accountMono = accountRepository.findAccount(number);
	    model.addAttribute("account", accountMono);
	}

	@PostMapping("/accounts")
	public String handle(@ModelAttribute Account account, BindingResult errors) {
		// ...
	}
----

In addition any model attributes that have a reactive type wrapper are resolved to their
actual values (and the model updated) just prior to view rendering.

`@ModelAttribute` can also be used as a method-level annotation on `@RequestMapping`
methods in which case the return value of the `@RequestMapping` method is interpreted as a
model attribute. This is typically not required, as it is the default behavior in HTML
controllers, unless the return value is a `String` which would otherwise be interpreted
as a view name. `@ModelAttribute` can also help to customize the model attribute name:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@GetMapping("/accounts/{id}")
	@ModelAttribute("myAccount")
	public Account handle() {
		// ...
		return account;
	}
----



[[webflux-ann-initbinder]]
=== Binder Methods
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-initbinder,Same in Spring MVC>>#

`@InitBinder` methods in an `@Controller` or `@ControllerAdvice` class can be used to
customize type conversion for method arguments that represent String-based request values
(e.g. request parameters, path variables, headers, cookies, and others). Type conversion
also applies during data binding of request parameters onto `@ModelAttribute` arguments
(i.e. command objects).

`@InitBinder` methods can register controller-specific `java.bean.PropertyEditor`, or
Spring `Converter` and `Formatter` components. In addition, the
<<webflux-config-conversion,WebFlux Java config>> can be used to register `Converter` and
`Formatter` types in a globally shared `FormattingConversionService`.

`@InitBinder` methods support many of the same arguments that a `@RequestMapping` methods
do, except for `@ModelAttribute` (command object) arguments. Typically they're are declared
with a `WebDataBinder` argument, for registrations, and a `void` return value.
Below is an example:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class FormController {

		**@InitBinder**
		public void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
			SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd");
			dateFormat.setLenient(false);
			binder.registerCustomEditor(Date.class, new CustomDateEditor(dateFormat, false));
		}

		// ...
	}
----

Alternatively when using a `Formatter`-based setup through a shared
`FormattingConversionService`, you could re-use the same approach and register
controller-specific ``Formatter``'s:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class FormController {

		**@InitBinder**
		protected void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
			binder.addCustomFormatter(new DateFormatter("yyyy-MM-dd"));
		}

		// ...
	}
----



[[webflux-ann-controller-advice]]
=== Controller Advice
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-ann-controller-advice,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Typically `@ExceptionHandler`, `@InitBinder`, and `@ModelAttribute` methods apply within
the `@Controller` class (or class hierarchy) they are declared in. If you want such
methods to apply more globally, across controllers, you can declare them in a class
marked with `@ControllerAdvice` or `@RestControllerAdvice`.

`@ControllerAdvice` is marked with `@Component` which means such classes can be registered
as Spring beans via <<core.adoc#beans-java-instantiating-container-scan,component scanning>>.
`@RestControllerAdvice` is also a meta-annotation marked with both `@ControllerAdvice` and
`@ResponseBody` which essentially means `@ExceptionHandler` methods are rendered to the
response body via message conversion (vs view resolution/template rendering).

On startup, the infrastructure classes for `@RequestMapping` and `@ExceptionHandler` methods
detect Spring beans of type `@ControllerAdvice`, and then apply their methods at runtime.
Global `@ExceptionHandler` methods (from an `@ControllerAdvice`) are applied *after* local
ones (from the `@Controller`). By contrast global `@ModelAttribute` and `@InitBinder`
methods are applied *before* local ones.

By default `@ControllerAdvice` methods apply to every request, i.e. all controllers, but
you can narrow that down to a subset of controllers via attributes on the annotation:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	// Target all Controllers annotated with @RestController
	@ControllerAdvice(annotations = RestController.class)
	public class ExampleAdvice1 {}

	// Target all Controllers within specific packages
	@ControllerAdvice("org.example.controllers")
	public class ExampleAdvice2 {}

	// Target all Controllers assignable to specific classes
	@ControllerAdvice(assignableTypes = {ControllerInterface.class, AbstractController.class})
	public class ExampleAdvice3 {}
----

Keep in mind the above selectors are evaluated at runtime and may negatively impact
performance if used extensively. See the
{api-spring-framework}/web/bind/annotation/ControllerAdvice.html[@ControllerAdvice]
Javadoc for more details.

[[webflux-config]]
== WebFlux Config
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config,Same in Spring MVC>>#

The WebFlux Java config declares components required to process requests with annotated
controllers or functional endpoints, and it offers an API to customize the configuration.
That means you do not need to understand the underlying beans created by the Java config
but, if you want to, it's very easy to see them in `WebFluxConfigurationSupport` or read more
what they are in <<webflux-special-bean-types>>.

For more advanced customizations, not available in the configuration API, it is also
possible to gain full control over the configuration through the
<<webflux-config-advanced-java>>.




[[webflux-config-enable]]
=== Enable WebFlux config
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config-enable,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Use the `@EnableWebFlux` annotation in your Java config:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig {
	}
----

The above registers a number of Spring WebFlux
<<mvc-webflux-special-bean-types,infrastructure beans>> also adapting to dependencies
available on the classpath -- for JSON, XML, etc.



[[webflux-config-customize]]
=== WebFlux config API
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config-customize,Same in Spring MVC>>#

In your Java config implement the `WebFluxConfigurer` interface:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

		// Implement configuration methods...

	}
----



[[webflux-config-conversion]]
=== Conversion, formatting
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config-conversion,Same in Spring MVC>>#

By default formatters for `Number` and `Date` types are installed, including support for
the `@NumberFormat` and `@DateTimeFormat` annotations. Full support for the Joda Time
formatting library is also installed if Joda Time is present on the classpath.

To register custom formatters and converters:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void addFormatters(FormatterRegistry registry) {
			// ...
		}

	}
----

[NOTE]
====
See <<core.adoc#format-FormatterRegistrar-SPI,FormatterRegistrar SPI>>
and the `FormattingConversionServiceFactoryBean` for more information on when to use FormatterRegistrars.
====



[[webflux-config-validation]]
=== Validation
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config-validation,Same in Spring MVC>>#

By default if <<core.adoc#validation-beanvalidation-overview,Bean Validation>> is present
on the classpath -- e.g. Hibernate Validator, the `LocalValidatorFactoryBean` is registered
as a global <<core.adoc#validator,Validator>> for use with `@Valid` and `Validated` on
`@Controller` method arguments.

In your Java config, you can customize the global `Validator` instance:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

		@Override
		public Validator getValidator(); {
			// ...
		}

	}
----

Note that you can also register ``Validator``'s locally:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Controller
	public class MyController {

		@InitBinder
		protected void initBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
			binder.addValidators(new FooValidator());
		}

	}
----

[TIP]
====
If you need to have a `LocalValidatorFactoryBean` injected somewhere, create a bean and
mark it with `@Primary` in order to avoid conflict with the one declared in the MVC config.
====



[[webflux-config-content-negotiation]]
=== Content type resolvers
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config-content-negotiation,Same in Spring MVC>>#

You can configure how Spring WebFlux determines the requested media types for
``@Controller``'s from the request. By default only the "Accept" header is checked but you
can also enable a query parameter based strategy.

To customize the requested content type resolution:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void configureContentTypeResolver(RequestedContentTypeResolverBuilder builder) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----



[[webflux-config-message-codecs]]
=== HTTP message codecs
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config-message-converters,Same in Spring MVC>>#

To customize how the request and response body are read and written:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void configureHttpMessageCodecs(ServerCodecConfigurer configurer) {

`ServerCodecConfigurer` provides a set of default readers and writers. You can use it to add
more readers and writers, customize the default ones, or replace the default ones completely.

For Jackson JSON and XML, consider using the
{api-spring-framework}/http/converter/json/Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder.html[Jackson2ObjectMapperBuilder]
which customizes Jackson's default properties with the following ones:

. http://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.6/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/DeserializationFeature.html#FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES[`DeserializationFeature.FAIL_ON_UNKNOWN_PROPERTIES`] is disabled.
. http://fasterxml.github.io/jackson-databind/javadoc/2.6/com/fasterxml/jackson/databind/MapperFeature.html#DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION[`MapperFeature.DEFAULT_VIEW_INCLUSION`] is disabled.

It also automatically registers the following well-known modules if they are detected on the classpath:

. https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-jdk7[jackson-datatype-jdk7]: support for Java 7 types like `java.nio.file.Path`.
. https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda[jackson-datatype-joda]: support for Joda-Time types.
. https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-jsr310[jackson-datatype-jsr310]: support for Java 8 Date & Time API types.
. https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-jdk8[jackson-datatype-jdk8]: support for other Java 8 types like `Optional`.



[[webflux-config-view-resolvers]]
=== View resolvers
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config-view-resolvers,Same in Spring MVC>>#

To configure view resolution:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void configureViewResolvers(ViewResolverRegistry registry) {
			// ...
		}
	}
----

The `ViewResolverRegistry` has shortcuts for view technologies that the Spring Framework
integrates with. Here is an example with FreeMarker which also requires configuring the
underlying FreeMarker view technology:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {


		@Override
		public void configureViewResolvers(ViewResolverRegistry registry) {
			registry.freeMarker();
		}

		// Configure Freemarker...

		@Bean
		public FreeMarkerConfigurer freeMarkerConfigurer() {
			FreeMarkerConfigurer configurer = new FreeMarkerConfigurer();
			configurer.setTemplateLoaderPath("classpath:/templates");
			return configurer;
		}
	}
----

You can also plug in any `ViewResolver` implementation:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {


		@Override
		public void configureViewResolvers(ViewResolverRegistry registry) {
			ViewResolver resolver = ... ;
			registry.viewResolver(resolver);
		}
	}
----

To support <<webflux-multiple-representations>> and rendering other formats
through view resolution, besides HTML, you can configure one or more default views based
on the `HttpMessageWriterView` implementation which accepts any of the available
<<webflux-codecs>> from `spring-web`:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {


		@Override
		public void configureViewResolvers(ViewResolverRegistry registry) {
			registry.freeMarker();

			Jackson2JsonEncoder encoder = new Jackson2JsonEncoder();
			registry.defaultViews(new HttpMessageWriterView(encoder));
		}

		// ...
	}
----

See <<webflux-view>> for more on the view technologies integrated with Spring WebFlux.




[[webflux-config-static-resources]]
=== Static resources
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config-static-resources,Same in Spring MVC>>#

This option provides a convenient way to serve static resources from a list of
{api-spring-framework}/core/io/Resource.html[Resource]-based locations.

In the example below, given a request that starts with `"/resources"`, the relative path is
used to find and serve static resources relative to `"/static"` on the classpath. Resources
will be served with a 1-year future expiration to ensure maximum use of the browser cache
and a reduction in HTTP requests made by the browser. The `Last-Modified` header is also
evaluated and if present a `304` status code is returned.

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
			registry.addResourceHandler("/resources/**")
				.addResourceLocations("/public", "classpath:/static/")
				.setCachePeriod(31556926);
		}

	}
----

// TODO:
// See also <<webflux-caching-static-resources, HTTP caching support for static resources>>.

The resource handler also supports a chain of
{api-spring-framework}/web/reactive/resource/ResourceResolver.html[ResourceResolver]'s and
{api-spring-framework}/web/reactive/resource/ResourceTransformer.html[ResourceTransformer]'s.
which can be used to create a toolchain for working with optimized resources.

The `VersionResourceResolver` can be used for versioned resource URLs based on an MD5 hash
computed from the content, a fixed application version, or other. A
`ContentVersionStrategy` (MD5 hash) is a good choice with some notable exceptions such as
JavaScript resources used with a module loader.

For example in your Java config;

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void addResourceHandlers(ResourceHandlerRegistry registry) {
			registry.addResourceHandler("/resources/**")
					.addResourceLocations("/public/")
					.resourceChain(true)
					.addResolver(new VersionResourceResolver().addContentVersionStrategy("/**"));
		}

	}
----

You can use `ResourceUrlProvider` to rewrite URLs and apply the full chain of resolvers and
transformers -- e.g. to insert versions. The WebFlux config provides a `ResourceUrlProvider`
so it can be injected into others.

Unlike Spring MVC at present in WebFlux there is no way to transparently rewrite static
resource URLs since there are no view technologies that can make use of a non-blocking chain
of resolvers and transformers (e.g. resources on Amazon S3). When serving only local
resources the workaround is to use `ResourceUrlProvider` directly (e.g. through a custom
tag) and block for 0 seconds.

http://www.webjars.org/documentation[WebJars] is also supported via `WebJarsResourceResolver`
and automatically registered when `"org.webjars:webjars-locator"` is present on the
classpath. The resolver can re-write URLs to include the version of the jar and can also
match to incoming URLs without versions -- e.g. `"/jquery/jquery.min.js"` to
`"/jquery/1.2.0/jquery.min.js"`.



[[webflux-config-path-matching]]
=== Path Matching
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config-path-matching,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Spring WebFlux uses parsed representation of path patterns -- i.e. `PathPattern`, and also
the incoming  request path -- i.e. `RequestPath`, which eliminates the need to indicate
whether to decode the request path, or remove semicolon content, since `PathPattern`
can now access decoded path segment values and match safely.

Spring WebFlux also does not support suffix pattern matching so effectively there are only two
minor options to customize related to path matching -- whether to match trailing slashes
(`true` by default) and whether the match is case-sensitive (`false`).

To customize those options:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	@EnableWebFlux
	public class WebConfig implements WebFluxConfigurer {

		@Override
		public void configurePathMatch(PathMatchConfigurer configurer) {
			// ...
		}

	}
----



[[webflux-config-advanced-java]]
=== Advanced config mode
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-config-advanced-java,Same in Spring MVC>>#

`@EnableWebFlux` imports `DelegatingWebFluxConfiguration` that (1) provides default
Spring configuration for WebFlux applications and (2) detects and delegates to
``WebFluxConfigurer``'s to customize that configuration.

For advanced mode, remove `@EnableWebFlux` and extend directly from
`DelegatingWebFluxConfiguration` instead of implementing `WebFluxConfigurer`:

[source,java,indent=0]
[subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
	@Configuration
	public class WebConfig extends DelegatingWebFluxConfiguration {

		// ...

	}
----

You can keep existing methods in `WebConfig` but you can now also override bean declarations
from the base class and you can still have any number of other ``WebMvcConfigurer``'s on
the classpath.




[[webflux-http2]]
== HTTP/2
[.small]#<<web.adoc#mvc-http2,Same in Spring MVC>>#

Servlet 4 containers are required to support HTTP/2 and Spring Framework 5 is compatible
with Servlet API 4. From a programming model perspective there is nothing specific that
applications need to do. However there are considerations related to server configuration.
For more details please check out the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/wiki/HTTP-2-support[HTTP/2 wiki page].

Currently Spring WebFlux does not support HTTP/2 with Netty. There is also no support for
pushing resources programmatically to the client.
