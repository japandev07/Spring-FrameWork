  <title>Spring Web Flow</title>

  <para>Spring Web Flow (SWF) aims to be the best solution for the management
  of web application page flow.</para>

  <para>SWF integrates with existing frameworks like Spring MVC, Struts, and
  JSF, in both servlet and portlet environments. If you have a business
  process (or processes) that would benefit from a conversational model as
  opposed to a purely request model, then SWF may be the solution.</para>

  <para>SWF allows you to capture logical page flows as self-contained modules
  that are reusable in different situations, and as such is ideal for building
  web application modules that guide the user through controlled navigations
  that drive business processes.</para>
